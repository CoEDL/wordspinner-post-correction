\ee This kangaroo is often seen in grassy plain areas. It has long thin legs and can hop fairly quickly. The meat is good to roast and eat. The 'kampun' (tendons) from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers). 'Ngalijirri' has the Nangala skin and 'jaliny' has the Japalyi skin. They are in a mother-son relationship.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

\ee Possums live in hollow trees and their climbing tracks can be seen on the trunks of trees that they live in. They were more common in the past than they are now, but there are still a lot in the Cattle Creek (Kunawa) area. In the past they were eaten a lot, but they have not been eaten much in recent times. Possum fur was used in the past to make 'warlpurr' and 'majarti' (loin cloths or 'cockrags' in Kriol) for men and women.

\ee The bark and leaves are used in bush medicine. They are boiled in water and the cooled liquid used as a wash to itchy skin, 'karlapa' (boils) and 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol). The outer bark is also burnt to form a fine black soot which can be rubbed through the hair to make it look it darker. In the past the charcoal from the burnt bark was rubbed onto the skin of light-skinned babies so that the welfare officers would not take them away. The wood can be used to make the shafts of spear-throwers. The large white flowers tell 'warrija' (crocodiles) and 'narrinyjila' (turtles) to get up on the banks and lay their eggs. Consequently when you see these flowers you know that it is a good time to collect these eggs to eat. The flowers also indicate that the hot weather of the build-up is about to begin.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

\ee This tree is used in bush medicine. You can dab the white sap onto 'marntara' (skin sores) to help them heal. You can also boil the bark and leaves and use the liquid to treat itchy skin and 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol). The fruit is also edible, but some people do not eat the fruit when they are brown. 'Yawu' (fish) and 'narrinyjila' (turtles) also eat the fruit when they fall in the water. 'Wirnangpurru' (kangaroos) eat the fruit when they fall on the ground. The straight dry stems are used to make fire-sticks or bush matches to light a fire using the traditional drilling or friction method. These fire-sticks were carried everywhere and could be used many times. In the wet season they were wrapped in paperbark to keep them dry. A straight, smooth, narrow stem is cut to about 40 cm long, and a broader heavier piece is cut and a small round hole with a vee carved into it. One end of the narrow stick is placed in the hole of the heavier stick. The narrow stick is then rotated quickly between the palms with a strong downward pressure. This drilling called 'pinyinyip' creates friction which in turn creates a very hot, fine dust. This dust pours down the vee carved into the wood onto a clump of fine, dry grass previously placed underneath. The grass and the very hot dust are gently blown upon until flames appear.

\ee Jartpurru is the only variety of bloodwood which is referred to by Gurindji people as 'bloodwood'. The sap from bloodwood is called 'nganyiwan' or 'tirnung'. It is collected from the north side of the tree and used as a medicinal wash or drink. To make the drink, it is boiled and then mixed with milk and kept in the fridge. This medicine is considered very powerful, able to cure 'kuliyan' (cancers). You can also find 'kurtakarla' (bush coconuts) on this tree. They are insect galls that have a hard brown or grey outer skin. When you break open bush coconuts you can find a small grub (larva) which you can eat. It is very sweet and tasty. The lerp or 'sugarleaf' (in Kriol) found on bloodwoods is called 'nanyjarrnga' and the nuts are called 'jirtpirtpi'.

You can also find 'namawurru' (sugarbag) in this tree. The red flowers can be sucked to get the sweet nectar. The seed pods are called 'ngapirlipirli'. You can burn the bark to make 'kawurn' (tobacco ashes). You can chew the leaves if you are thirsty. Chewing the leaves helps produce 'jawul' (saliva) and stops the feeling of intense thirst.

\ee Bilbies have long ears, pointy noses and long tails with white tips. They live in sand-hill country in southern areas and dig large burrows that they live in during the hot weather. They are not seen now. In the old days, people hunted them by digging the burrows up. People would stand near holes to catch them if they ran out. They were eaten and the tails were used to make ceremony decorations called 'yarningki' worn around the necks of young men. The long black and white tails were also used in women's ceremonies.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, bush turkeys are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jikparn' and eat them.

\ee This small hunting bird can hover in one place for long periods looking for prey. You often see them hovering at the start of the cold weather.
There is a Dreaming story about two 'kurrarntal' (brolgas)  who lived near Kunawa (Cattle Creek station). The sisters who had the skin name Nampijina were digging for 'kamara' (yams) on a large blacksoil plain. They kept the good yams for themselves and wouldn't give any to their Japarta grandsons, who were 'palinypaliny' (kestrels). So the Japartas flew overhead and landed on the eastside of the plain and made a fire. One of the 'palinypaliny' took the fire west and the two 'kurrarntal' (brolgas) were unable to escape and were burnt. As they burnt to death, they huddled together, one on top of the other. Now two rocks can be found in their place.

'Luma', the desert blue-tongue has orange stripes on its skin, while 'jiwili' has darker stripes. Both types can be called 'lungkura'. They are easy to catch, however they do have a very strong bite. They cannot run quickly and can be picked up by grabbing them firmly around the neck. They can be caught all year round. The flesh can be roasted in a ground oven, a cooking technique called 'turturl'. They have tasty fat similar to that of a goanna. They have special powers and can fight with king brown snakes and kill them.

\ee These mussels are found in rivers and creeks often under rocks. They are long and thin. They are roasted on hot coals and eaten. Mussels cannot be eaten by boys; men can only eat them after they have been initiated. The meat can also be boiled in water with a little salt and made into 'yingalk' (soup) and this can be drunk to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) and 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The juice from mussels can also be used to treat ear aches and infections. It is dripped straight into the ear.

\xe We singe the kangaroo on the fire until it is done. Then we gut the kangaroo. We take its guts out. Then we cut the kangaroo open. We take the guts out. We take out the liver, lungs and everything. We put them on some leafy branches. Then we put the hot rocks in (the body cavity). The rocks are heated up on the fire. We get the hot rocks and put them here in the stomach. We put them right up here (inside the chest cavity). We put maybe two in this way. Some further down and here in the middle [of the chest cavity]. We push some hot rocks up into the chest cavity with a stick. We get some leafy bloodwood branches then. And we put them inside the stomach. We get some more that we've broken off and then cover the whole animal with paperbark to cook it. The guts which we got out, the liver and whatnot, well we cook the whole lot on the hot coals. We roast it - the liver and the lungs, its guts, the big organs and the small ones too. We roast those parts. The carcass cooks in the ground like that. When we take it out of the ground it is really nicely roasted.

\ee This is a Ngarinyman or Bilinarra word. The Gurindji word is 'wirnangpurru'. Male kangaroos are called 'warawungku' and female kangaroos are called 'kumpang' or 'pungkiyin'. Hunting for kangaroos is called 'wumaj', 'yurtap' or 'yangkarrp'. The general term for pinkys or kangaroo fetuses is 'pilyily'. Little children should not hold them because they might develop bad knees. Larger joeys that have hair and are still getting in and out of the pouch are 'wulungarna' or 'wartangarna', referring to how they follow around their mothers legs. The pouch is called 'puul'. Middle size joeys are called 'kamurrkilang' in Malngin which is the name for a middle child in Gurindji.

\ee Jungkuwurru often live in rocky country where they hide in crevasses and cracks. Their homes are called 'ngurlunyjurna'. They can be pulled out with wire hooks or hooked branches. They are much more commonly seen at night when they walk around looking for food. They are most active during full moon periods in the cold weather of the dry season. Night hunting for echidna is called 'waramarla'. When they walk they leave a little track where the prickles drag along the ground. When they are approached, they roll into a tight ball to protect themselves. Their favourite foods are 'pingi' (ants) and 'munkurt' (termites) which they eat with their 'jalany' (tongue). They are often found near termite mounds called 'tamarra'. During the hot weather of the build-up they can be found in cool areas near 'lamarn' (rivers), where they look for wet ground that is cool to sleep on. The name 'Jungkuwurru' is derived from Jaminjung (jungku=point of elbow plus -wurru=having). Porcupines or echidnas are also often called 'paka-yawung' (having spikes). Large echidnas are called 'purnukangu'. Echidnas are eaten. The meat is sweet like pork. It has a lot of tasty white coloured fat. You need to chop off the spines and feet prior to cooking the whole body in a ground oven. You can soften the spines by placing them on hot coals for a short time or by placing them in a bucket of very hot water. The flesh cannot be eaten by young boys and mothers during initiation ceremonies. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) cannot eat them because the spikes might poke the baby and it will be born a cripple. It can be eaten after a 'needle' from them is hammered into a 'wanyarri' or 'jingi' (bauhinia). They are a Dreaming or totem for some people who cannot eat them. There is an important Dreamtime or creation period story about Jungkuwurru that relates to how he got his prickles. Jungkuwurru got mad when he found out that the other animals weren't giving him the good beef. He took all the shade trees away, but the other animals speared him, giving him his prickles.

It also holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. The flesh can be roasted and eaten, but it does not taste very good. The 'kampun' (tendons) from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers).

\ee Emus are not seen much near Kalkaringi, but they are plentiful in some bush areas on Gurindji country. Emus eat many of the bush tucker fruit that people also eat. They also eat many insects. In the early days people hunted them with 'mirlarrang' (spears) and 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). If a spear missed, a boomerang would be thrown at the legs to make it fall down. Hunters also waited for them at billabongs where they knelt to drink. They were easy targets then. When killed, emus are gutted and the 'karnngirri' (guts) are throw away, but the 'tulang' (heart), 'marlumpa' (liver) and 'wararr' (fat) can be put back in for cooking. The bird is then cooked in a ground oven using a method called 'turturl', with 'kuruwarrany' (hot stones) placed inside the gut cavity, then covered with paperbark to keep the meat clean. The meat is dark and smells strong. You can also eat the eggs. Baby emus are called 'wininiwinini', a family of emus is called 'warnangaliny' and the feathers of an emu are called 'wanya'. A number of major Dreaming tracks associated with Yiparrartu go through Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

\ee The wood of this tree is hard and strong. It can be used to make 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs), 'mirta' (shields) and 'kuturu' (fighting sticks). The timber makes excellent 'warlu' (firewood). The bark can be burnt to make 'kawurn' (tobacco ashes).

\ee This plant grows on 'palangari' (black soil plains) that become very water-logged in the wet season. The yams are good to eat and are long like sweet potatoes. The yam may be dug up easily as they are not very deep and the black soil is easy to dig. They are best dug up soon after the wet season finishes when the soil is still soft. They are eaten after a short roasting in hot coals. In the old days, the small sweet and tasty yams were called 'julu' which also refers to navels or umbilical cords. These days the young yams are called 'pilyilya', which is a more general word for anything young. These are like baby carrots and are probably the first year tubers that are tender. They are attached to the trailing branches of the vine.

\ee Mosquitoes are often flying around at dawn and dusk and they suck your 'kungulu' (blood). They can be chased away by lighting a smoky fire or by placing dry manure from horses or cattle on the coals. The smoke from burning 'manyingila' (gutta-percha) and 'ngamanpurru' (conkerberry) is especially good for repelling mosquitoes. The activity of mosquitoes, including their noise and bite, is referred to as 'ngiing'. There is a Mosquito Dreaming site near the Nitjpurru (Pigeon Hole) turnoff along the highway which is a cluster of small stony hills.

\ee The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks) . The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, people would follow the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs were collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs were ready to be collected was when 'purrju' (march flies) started biting. There is a Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who lived at Liyapiti near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

\ee This small python is considered to be the offspring of 'mulyukuna' (black-headed python). It has pretty markings on the skin and is also sometimes called a pie-bald snake. It is a quiet snake that can be picked up and handled. It is too small to be eaten. This snake has a Dreaming site to the west of Gurindji and Bilinarra country. It has a Gurindji Dreaming story about when it cried because others teased it about its hair. The name 'kujipatawan' refers to it having strong bones.

\ee The sticky leaves and stems can be used for medicine. They are boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) or itchy skin. The 'jikala' (wax) may be obtained by burning the sticky leaves and stems. This resin is soft when it is hot but as it cools it sets very hard and is used as glue. It may be used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads), 'kurrwa' (axe heads) and spear-thrower 'narra' (hooks). Burning the leaves also produces smoke that repels 'kanamarurru' or 'kinarli' (mosquitoes). The spinifex is also used in a fishing technique called 'kilkilp' where the grass is rolled along in the water.

\ee Emus are not seen much near Kalkaringi, but they are plentiful in some bush areas on Gurindji country. Emus eat many of the bush tucker fruit that people also eat. They also eat many insects. In the early days people hunted them with 'mirlarrang' (spears) and 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). If a spear missed, a boomerang would be thrown at the legs to make it fall down. Hunters also waited for them at billabongs where they knelt to drink. They were easy targets then. When killed, emus are gutted and the 'karnngirri' (guts) are throw away, but the 'tulang' (heart), 'marlumpa' (liver) and 'wararr' (fat) can be put back in for cooking. The bird is then cooked in a ground oven using a method called 'turturl', with 'kuruwarrany' (hot stones) placed inside the gut cavity, then covered with paperbark to keep the meat clean. The meat is dark and smells strong. You can also eat the eggs. Baby emus are called 'wininiwinini', a family of emus is called 'warnangaliny' and the feathers of an emu are called 'wanya'. A number of major Dreaming tracks associated with Yiparrartu go through Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

The fruit can also be collected from the ground when they are dry. If the fruit are bitter they can be boiled with sugar to make them sweet. Another way of preparing them is to warm them on the hot coals. They are also cooked wrapped with 'marlin' or 'nalij' (green water weed). This moistens them and makes them nicer to eat. If there are lots of unripe fruit they can be lightly cooked in a ground oven to make them ripen quickly. The leafy, rounded canopy provides dense, cool shade.

They eat 'yirna' (flowers) from many trees, especially 'pakarli' (paperbarks). They also like the fruit of 'nampula' (cluster figs) and 'nyimili' (Leichhardt trees). In the past they were killed by throwing hunting sticks into the roosting colonies. The flesh was roasted and eaten. The meat has a strong distinctive smell and taste. 'Warrija' (crocodiles) also eat them when they roost in paperbark trees hanging over 'lamarn' (rivers) and 'langkarna' (billabongs). This is also a good place to fish as there are many fish under the colonies.

The smoke from burning 'manyingila' (gutta-percha) and 'ngamanpurru' (conkerberry) is especially good for repelling mosquitoes. The activity of mosquitoes, including their noise and bite, is referred to as 'ngiing'.

\ee Eel-tail catfish used to be caught with a spinifex bundle used as a 'warni' (fish net) or with a ''kilkilpkaji' (clap sticks)' (spear). They generally do not take bait on a 'wuyurrun' (hand-line). The larger ones can be roasted and eaten. The smaller ones are used as bait to catch larger fish such as 'manyirrkirla' (barramundi). These eel-tail catfish also have dangerous spines that must be carefully avoided. 'Marnpa' is the term used for young catfish without spikes, while 'kinyang' refers to the larger catfish with dangerous spines. These fish often eat small stones that look like the fruit of 'partiki' (nut trees) and the name 'partikipany' refers to this. This fish is also dangerous and can be used in sorcery. Drawing the fish on the cliffs of Seale Gorge at Parlngarrawuny will harm someone magically.

Took out 'This fish is dangerous and can be used in sorcery. Drawing the fish on the cliffs of Seale Gorge will harm someone magically.' because it is probably associated with men. Added 'marina' and 'partikipan' as syn. Put Seale Gorge info back in. Not that secret.

After that they would put it in another coolamon. They showed us so we know how to put the seed in the coolamon. They used to sprinkle water on it and then eat it. It's the white one that spills out this way. That's the good seed. And it was the husks that they would separate from it. Then they'd put it [in a coolamon]. We'd eat it mixed with water.

\ee The 'purnku' (seeds) inside the 'kanparna' (pods) are edible, but not the hairs. The seeds are taken out of the large pod. They are then pounded, winnowed out or burnt to get rid of the 'jilipija' (husks) which have fine hairs of the skin. Finally they are crushed, eaten raw or made into johnny cakes. The skin of the inner pod of the fruit can also be rubbed on the skin to make it lighter like Mungamunga women's skin. When the sunsets in the mid dry season turn red and streaky it tells you that the fruit are ready to be collected.

It can also be used to treat sore legs and hips, and sore muscles in general. 'Lamawurt' (witchetty grubs) can be found at the base in the roots of the tree.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

Ripe fruit are gently rubbed and squeezed until the inner flesh becomes soft and pulpy. A small hole is made in the skin and the liquid squeezed out and rubbed onto skin disorders such as rashes and ringworm, or to use as eye-drops. This cucumber tastes bitter and grows on the plains country. The fruit can be eaten, but you have to wait until they ripen fully and they have a bitter taste.

\ee This is a Bilinarra word. When the fruit are ripe they have a strong pleasant smell, which can be noticed from a long way from the plant. This ripe and strong smelling fruit is called 'mawukarl' or 'kirnti'. They go a slightly orange-yellow colour when they ripen and are sweet. Unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help ripen them which might take as long as two weeks. The wood can be used as 'warlu' (firewood) as it lights quickly and easily. The bark can be used to treat scabies. It is chipped off the trunk, crushed into small pieces and boiled. The cooled liquid is used as an external wash to treat scabies. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season come this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is wafted towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

The sticks would be thrown into the flocks and sometimes a large number of birds would be caught. These were lightly roasted and then eaten; the younger ones were tender and tasty. The young budgerigars were also collected from the hollow trees by widening the entry into the trees and reaching in and taking them out.

The bark and leaves can be burnt to a fine white ash, which is mixed with 'warlayarra' (tobacco). This improves the texture of the tobacco and also makes it release more nicotine.

Young people cannot eat the meat from this snake. If they do they will become crippled. Only elders can eat the meat. This snake also has a sacred song that can only be heard by men. Note that this identification is not certain. In the 'Plant and Animal' book it is given as the olive python.

\ee When the fruit are ripe they have a strong pleasant smell, which can be noticed from a long way from the plant. This ripe and strong smelling fruit is called 'mawukarl' or 'kirnti'. They go a slightly orange-yellow colour when they ripen and are sweet. Unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help ripen them which might take as long as two weeks. The wood can be used as 'warlu' (firewood) as it lights quickly and easily. The bark can be used to treat scabies. It is chipped off the trunk, crushed into small pieces and boiled. The cooled liquid is used as an external wash to treat scabies. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season come this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is wafted towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

Wanyil was very careful with the grindstone and wouldn't let Yawarlwarl use it. But Wanyil would only half-grind the seed which annoyed Yawarlwarl. At one point Wanyil went to get some water and Yawarlwarl took the opportunity to steal the stone. She carried it off, camping overnight at Pirlingkalurlungka. She then went on to Yawarlwarl where she placed the stone upright. You can still see the stone there to this day.

\ee There are two types of blue-tongue lizards. They are quite similar but distinctly different in skin colour. 'Luma', the desert blue-tongue has orange stripes on its skin, while 'jiwili' has darker stripes. Both types can be called 'lungkura'. They are easy to catch, however they do have a very strong bite. They cannot run quickly and can be picked up by grabbing them firmly around the neck. They can be caught all year round. The flesh can be roasted in a ground oven, a cooking technique called 'turturl'. They have tasty fat similar to that of a goanna. They have special powers and can fight with king brown snakes and kill them. Luma is an important character in a story associated with Lutu. Lutu is in Malngin country on Stirling Creek towards Limbunya Station. It is a large rockhole surrounded by blacksoil plains which span a distance equivalent to the area from Kalkaringi to Daguragu. Luma threw his favourite 'kurrupartu' (boomerang) across the plains. Without realising it, it landed in Lutu and sank into its depths. Luma went everywhere all over the plains looking for his boomerang, but his search was in vain. He cried and cried, rubbing his eyes, making a black stripe under them. Finally he realised it had landed in Lutu. Luma remains there beside Lutu today in the form of a 'kurlartarti' (bush orange tree).

They kept the good yams for themselves and wouldn't give any to their Japarta grandsons, who were 'palinypaliny' (kestrels). So the Japartas flew overhead and landed on the eastside of the plain and made a fire. One of the 'palinypaliny' took the fire west and the two 'kurrarntal' (brolgas) were unable to escape and were burnt. As they burnt to death, they huddled together, one on top of the other. Now two rocks can be found in their place.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

It holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. These kangaroos sometimes have a distinctive 'pungkurl' (humped back) and these kangaroos are called 'wanyil' or 'kakuya'. They can be roasted in a ground oven and eaten, but do not taste very good. The tendons, called 'kampun', from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers).

You slit their throat and cook them upside down. They are then salted and eaten from the shell. The meat stews in the blood and juices making it tasty.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

\ee This is a Warlpiri word. These white grubs live in tree trunks and roots of bloodwoods, 'marlan' or the red river gum, and wattle species such as 'mulurrmi', 'kirrpirli', 'pirrpun' and 'puntarrji'. Witchetty grubs are spotted by looking for the entrance hole with associated 'puntu' or fine dust or 'kura' or excrement on the trunk and branches. The wood is then chopped just above the hole to widen it, and the grub pulled out with a piece of thin hooked wire or a hooked stick called a 'narra'. This process is called 'wililip'. They can be eaten raw or lightly cooked in hot ashes. They taste like scrambled eggs and are much sought after. They can also be used as bait when fishing.

It is often used in conjunction with 'yirrijkaji'. You wash in it everyday for three days. Alternatively the leaves of 'lawa', 'yirrijkaji' and 'marlarn' can be put into a fire pit which has burnt down and children are held over the pit to inhale the smoke and allow it to waft over their skin. The leaves of the 'lawa' can also be heated up on the coals of a fire and applied to a person's head to alleviate a headache or applied to sore, swollen feet.

\ee The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks) . The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, people would follow the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs were collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs were ready to be collected was when 'purrju' (march flies) started biting. There is a Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who lived at Liyapiti near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

\ee This is a Malgin word. There are two types of blue-tongue lizards. They are quite similar but distinctly different in skin colour. 'Luma', the desert blue-tongue has orange stripes on its skin, while 'jiwili' has darker stripes. Both types can be called 'lungkura'. They are easy to catch, however they do have a very strong bite. They cannot run quickly and can be picked up by grabbing them firmly around the neck. They can be caught all year round. The flesh can be roasted in a ground oven, a cooking technique called 'turturl'. They have tasty fat similar to that of a goanna. They have special powers and can fight with king brown snakes and kill them. Luma is a character in a story associated with Lutu. Lutu is in Malngin country on Stirling Creek towards Limbunya Station. It is a large rockhole surrounded by blacksoil plains which span a distance equivalent to the area from Kalkaringi to Daguragu. Luma threw his favourite 'kurrupartu' (boomerang) across the plains. Without realising it, it landed in Lutu and sank into its depths. Luma went everywhere all over the plains looking for his boomerang, but his search was in vain. He cried and cried, rubbing his eyes, making a black stripe under them. Finally he realised it had landed in Lutu. Luma remains there beside Lutu today in the form of a 'kurlartarti' (bush orange tree).

\ee This small tree or shrub grows in areas of sandstone country. The leaves and twigs can be used as fish poison. The leaves are thrown into small waterholes and after a period the fish float to the surface and can be easily collected. The wood can be used to make spears called 'mirlarrang', 'mirta' (shields), clap-sticks called 'kilkilpkaji' and 'kuturu' (fighting-sticks).

\ee There are two types of blue-tongue lizards. They are quite similar but distinctly different in skin colour. 'Luma', the desert blue-tongue has orange stripes on its skin, while 'jiwili' has darker stripes. Both types can be called 'lungkura'. They are easy to catch, however they do have a very strong bite. They cannot run quickly and can be picked up by grabbing them firmly around the neck. They can be caught all year round. The flesh can be roasted in a ground oven, a cooking technique called 'turturl'. They have tasty fat similar to that of a goanna. They have special powers and can fight with king brown snakes and kill them. Luma is an important character in a story associated with Lutu. Lutu is in Malngin country on Stirling Creek towards Limbunya Station. It is a large rockhole surrounded by blacksoil plains which span a distance equivalent to the area from Kalkaringi to Daguragu. Luma threw his favourite 'kurrupartu' (boomerang) across the plains. Without realising it, it landed in Lutu and sank into its depths. Luma went everywhere all over the plains looking for his boomerang, but his search was in vain. He cried and cried, rubbing his eyes, making a black stripe under them. Finally he realised it had landed in Lutu. Luma remains there beside Lutu today in the form of a 'kurlartarti' (bush orange tree).

\ee Lutu is a large rockhole surrounded by blacksoil plains which span a distance equivalent to the area from Kalkaringi to Daguragu. An important story associated with the site regards Luma (Bluetongue) and his 'kurrupartu' (boomerang). Luma threw his favourite boomerang across the plains. Without realising it, it landed in Lutu and sank into its depths. Luma went everywhere all over the plains looking for his boomerang, but his search was in vain. He cried and cried, rubbing his eyes, making a black stripe under them. Finally he realised it had landed in Lutu. Luma remains there beside Lutu today in the form of a 'kurlartarti' (bush orange tree).

This ripe and strong smelling fruit is called 'mawukarl' or 'kirnti'. They go a slightly orange-yellow colour when they ripen and are sweet. Unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help ripen them which might take as long as two weeks. The wood can be used as 'warlu' (firewood) as it lights quickly and easily. The bark can be used to treat scabies. It is chipped off the trunk, crushed into small pieces and boiled. The cooled liquid is used as an external wash to treat scabies. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season come this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is wafted towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

The whole plant can be placed onto a 'kawarla' (coolamon) and the seeds are winnowed out and collected. When enough are available, they are ground up using a 'jungari' (grinding stone). The flour is then mixed with water and made into small dampers. These are lightly cooked then eaten. Dampers are very good food and in the past it was an important food source, however, making the food was hard work. The seeds are also eaten by cockatoos.

\ee Pregnant women cannot eat barramundi because something might get stuck in the baby's throat and cause it to swell up. If an expectant father kills a barramundi, the spirit of the fish might go into the pregnant woman and the child. Alternatively if an expectant father catches a barramundi, the child might be born with a 'nawun' (birth mark). For example, if the man rips the lip of the barramundi taking out the hook, the child may be born with a harelip.

\ee Barramundi can get large and are hard to catch as they fight hard to get off the line. They are common in billabongs and the big rivers. They are mostly caught using live bait on 'wuyurrun' (hand-lines). The flesh is roasted on hot coals, a cooking technique called 'wupkarra'. Yinarrwa has the skin name Nalyirri. Small barramundi are called 'marna' and large ones are called 'pirlapirla'.

At Daguragu itself there is a Dreaming rock. If you cover it with white ochre and brush it with branches then conkerberries will spring up everywhere. Similarly conkerberry trees at a Dreaming site near Lawi will produce a good crop if you hit the water and splash it everywhere. In the old days, the bushes were also used to make houses.

This liquid has a good smell like Vicks. The leaves may also be placed on a burnt down fire to produce smoke. The patient is then rubbed with 'wararr' (fat) and treated with the smoke. This heals the person by passing the smell of the tree over them. Babies and small children are held over the smoking leaves. The leaves can also be used as fish poison. Small branches and twigs are thrown into small waterholes, or the branches are dragged through the water. The fish become dazed and float to the surface, where they can be easily collected, cooked and eaten. The leaves can also be added to meat being cooked in a ground oven. They keep the meat moist and give the meat a good flavour. 'Ngimal' (small leafy branches) can also be spread on the ground to keep meat clean while it is being prepared and after it is cooked. 'Ngarlu' (sugarbag) can be found in this tree. The wood also makes good 'warlu' (firewood). 'Lamawurt' (witchetty grubs) can also be found in the lower trunk of this tree. The sugar-leaf, a sweet edible insect, collected from this tree is called 'purrngun'.

\ee Eel-tail catfish used to be caught with a spinifex bundle used as a 'warni' (fish net) or with a 'mirlarrang' (spear). They generally do not take bait on a 'wuyurrun' (hand-line). The larger ones can be roasted and eaten. The smaller ones are used as bait to catch larger fish such as 'manyirrkirla' (barramundi). These eel-tail catfish also have dangerous spines that must be carefully avoided. 'Marnpa' is the term used for young catfish without spikes, while 'kinyang' refers to the larger catfish with dangerous spines. These fish often eat small stones that look like the fruit of 'partiki' (nut trees) and the name 'partikipany' refers to this. This fish is also dangerous and can be used in sorcery. Drawing the fish on the cliffs of Seale Gorge at Parlngarrawuny will harm someone magically.

\ee This word is from Bilinarra. Termite mounds are used in bush medicine. The fine soil from inside the ant hill is used to treat 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The inner soil is heated on a fire and then added to water and mixed with 'warrwa' ashes. You let the grass bits settle out before you drink it. Heated antbed is also used to treat or 'cook' babies. The antbed is crushed and mixed with 'ngirirri' ash. Newborns are slathered with this warm wet mix to close their fontanelles and strengthen their bodies. Mothers with newborn babies also add water to this mix and drink it to promote their milk. Around the age of one, mothers 'cook'  babies' lower backs and legs in the same mixture to help them start walking. You can also put antbed on a fire with water and the baby is held in the smoke and steam. This makes sure the baby physically strong in later life. You can also use antbed with other bush medicines including 'warlayara'. 'Warlayara' is added to the wet slurry after the antbed has been heated up. This is a dryer mixture. You can also find 'nangkalij' (ground sugarbag) in termite mounds, especially the large rounded mounds. You can also find 'jungkuwurru' (porcupines or echidnas) camped in the holes in termite mounds. They like to eat the 'munkurt' (termites) inside. In the past the larger mounds were hollowed out in the centre and you could sit in them during heavy rain periods and stay dry.

\ee The Warrija Kirrawa (Crocodile and Goanna) story is based here. The story begins with Kirrawa as a water creature and Warrija as an animal who could only float. Warrija envies Kirrawa's ability to dive deep into the water. Kirrawa feels sorry for his friend and collects some martiya (bush gum) and sticks it to Warrija's back and tail. He creates the ridges you can see on crocodiles today. Warrija finds he can now dive deeply and leaves his friend to live in the depths of the river. Before he leaves, he tells Kirrawa to learn to become a bush animal, and so he does.

\ee The 'pumparta' (fruit) are collected from the bottom of the water by feeling around in an action called 'waap', 'patpat' or 'mararap'. The skin is peeled off to expose the seeds which can be eaten. The seeds are very tasty and somewhat oily. The fruit are roasted and eaten or they may be eaten uncooked. The seeds can also be dried in the sun and then ground into a flour to make 'mangarri' (johnnycakes) which are also roasted and eaten. The flower is called 'kulkutukutu'. The stem can also be eaten after the green outer skin has been peeled off. The tuber in the mud may also be eaten after it has been roasted. It is called 'yirrngan'. The darker ones are considered to be the mother of the yam or 'ngatinyan', and their babies are referred to as 'nanta'.

\ee The wood of this tree is hard, strong and dark in colour. It makes excellent 'warlu' (firewood) as it burns evenly for long periods. The smoke from burning wood repels mosquitoes. The stems can be used for bough shelters, fence rails and fence posts. The wood is also used for 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs), 'kilkilpkaji' (clap sticks), spear heads, 'mirta' (shields) and 'kuturu' (hitting sticks).

They are sometimes kept as pets and are tied up with a piece of string like a little dog. They do not naturally occur on Gurindji country but are known by their Warlpiri name from further south.

\ee This is a Bilinarra word. You can use the ashes mixed with 'tamarra' (termite mound) to treat babies. You lie the baby down on a layer of this mix and more is piled around the baby and firmly pressed against the arms, chest, throat, hips, lower back and legs. The child's legs are straightened as the hot mix is applied. This procedure, called 'kamparnup' (cooking) has the effect of closing the baby's 'ngamany' (fontanelle) and strengthening the baby's legs in preparation for 'kalu' (walking). Adults with sore joints are also treated this way. You can also use the 'ngarlaka' (seeds) to treat small children. You boil the seeds and make babies sit in the liquid. It makes their legs strong, helping them to start walking. The hard timber makes good 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). In the past, people made 'yarnarnti' (ashes) from burning the leaves. These ashes were mixed with tobacco and chewed.

\ee The sticky leaves and stems can be used for medicine. They are boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) or itchy skin. The 'jikala' (wax) may be obtained by burning the sticky leaves and stems. This resin is soft when it is hot but as it cools it sets very hard and is used as glue. It may be used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads), 'kurrwa' (axe heads) and spear-thrower 'narra' (hooks). Burning the leaves also produces smoke that repels 'kanamarurru' or 'kinarli' (mosquitoes). The spinifex is also used in a fishing technique called 'kilkilp' where the grass is rolled along in the water.

They are then pounded, winnowed out or burnt to get rid of the 'jilipija' (husks) which have fine hairs of the skin. Finally they are crushed, eaten raw or made into johnny cakes. The skin of the inner pod of the fruit can also be rubbed on the skin to make it lighter like Mungamunga women's skin. When the sunsets in the mid dry season turn red and streaky it tells you that the fruit are ready to be collected.

\ee This is a Malngin word. This tree has small leaves and white sap. It grows on plains and along creek lines. You can boil the leaves and use the liquid to wash sores on the scalp caused by nits. You can also burn the wood and use the smoke to keep mosquitoes away. The smoke has a nice smell. The hard dark timber also is good for making 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) and 'mirta' (shields). The branches and leaves can also be used as fish poison. You drag them through small waterholes, making the fish float to the surface, where they can be collected, cooked and eaten. You should not get the white milk-like sap near your eye as it can cause blindness. 'Namawurru' or 'ngarlu' (sugarbag) can be found in this tree.

\ee The 'muying' tree is found near springs and river. It has small plum coloured fruit that ripen in the wet season. The black fruit are eaten when they are ripe. They are very sweet and tasty. Traditionally they are collected off the ground because picking fruit from the tree was said to cause eye disease. The fruit can also be pounded on a flat rock and made into small dampers, which are lightly roasted and are highly regarded as a food source. In the old days the dry sweet fruit was washed then cooked in bark or a coolamon with small hot flat rocks. The ripe juicy fruit was also washed then pounded on rocks before being eaten, particularly by people with bad teeth. The fruit are generally produced around the early wet season, but sometimes are available later in the year. When the firefly begins blinking its light, it tells you the fruit are ripe and ready to eat. The straight dry stems are used to make fire-sticks or bush matches. They are used to light a fire using the traditional drilling or friction method called 'pinyinyip'.

\ee The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks) . The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, people would follow the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs were collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs were ready to be collected was when 'purrju' (march flies) started biting. There is a Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who lived at Liyapiti near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag is considered a mild laxative which 'opens up' your stomach. The general terms for sugarbag are 'namawurru' or 'ngarlu' which also refer to the sweet dark honey. The honey is referred to specifically as 'ngunyjung'. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalij', 'nangkaliny' or 'yarlukura'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngarlu' or 'namawurru'. The entrance hole of the hive is called 'jurrkiny' which has a nose or veranda over the hole. The small stingless bee is called 'nama' or 'lanu'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kuntarri', 'kumpaying' or 'ngunyuwulij'. The wax is called 'jikala', 'piyarnak', or 'tarla'. The separation between the honey and wax, and the pollen is called 'jirnuk'. The honey, wax and pollen all mixed up together is referred to as 'kirrang'. A full hive is called 'ngitiwuny'. The egg of the bee is called 'kurla'. Bee droppings are called 'jayurrk' and are seen below the hive entrance holes on the ground. This signals that the hive is active. The word for sugarbag season is 'tulwarrangkarrakmirntij' (the season of blossoms) and there are specific words for chopping at a tree to get honey, 'pirntirrp' or 'tarlawurlp' and digging into the hole with your fingers and sampling the honey, 'ngampij' or 'ngapinykarra'. A stick or small brush which is used to get honey out of a tree that cannot be chopped open is called a 'jamawurn'.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag is considered a mild laxative which 'opens up' your stomach. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalij' or 'nangkaliny' or 'yarlukura'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngarlu' or 'namawurru'. The entrance hole of the hive is called 'jurrkiny' which has a nose or veranda over the hole. The small stingless bee is called 'nama' or 'lanu'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kuntarri', 'kumpaying' or 'ngunyuwulij'. The wax is called 'jikala', 'piyarnak', or 'tarla'. The separation between the honey and wax, and the pollen is called 'jirnuk'. The honey, wax and pollen all mixed up together is referred to as 'kirrang'. A full hive is called 'ngitiwuny'. The egg of the bee is called 'kurla'. Bee droppings are called 'jayurrk' and are seen below the hive entrance holes on the ground. This signals that the hive is active. The word for sugarbag season is 'tulwarrangkarrakmirntij' (the season of blossoms) and there are specific words for chopping at a tree to get honey, 'pirntirrp' or 'tarlawurlp' and digging into the hole with your fingers and sampling the honey, 'ngampij' or 'ngapinykarra'. A stick or small brush which is used to get honey out of a tree that cannot be chopped open is called a 'jamawurn'.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method which is called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

The women from the old days used to put them in coolamons. It didn't matter if they bit them, they would just brush them off themselves. [They would collect them] to winnow. They would winnow them in a coolamon. The good part would fall this way. And the dirt, sticks and grit would fall out that way. The white eggs would come out on this side. They'd keep going then they would get some grass, you know the one, the grass which is as big as this, which grows there. Then they would eat [the eggs] with that type of grass. That's how they used to eat ants in the old days. They used to eat them using coolamons as plates. Those little black ants which bite - well they'd eat the eggs.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag is considered a mild laxative which 'opens up' your stomach. The general terms for sugarbag are 'namawurru' or 'ngarlu' which also refer to the sweet dark honey. The honey is referred to specifically as 'ngunyjung'. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalij' or 'nangkaliny' or 'yarlukura'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngarlu' or 'namawurru'. The entrance hole of the hive is called 'jurrkiny' which has a nose or veranda over the hole. The small stingless bee is called 'nama' or 'lanu'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kuntarri', 'kumpaying' or 'ngunyuwulij'. The wax is called 'jikala', 'piyarnak', or 'tarla'. The separation between the honey and wax, and the pollen is called 'jirnuk'. The honey, wax and pollen all mixed up together is referred to as 'kirrang'. A full hive is called 'ngitiwuny'. The egg of the bee is called 'kurla'. Bee droppings are called 'jayurrk' and are seen below the hive entrance holes on the ground. This signals that the hive is active. The word for sugarbag season is 'tulwarrangkarrakmirntij' (the season of blossoms) and there are specific words for chopping at a tree to get honey, 'pirntirrp' or 'tarlawurlp' and digging into the hole with your fingers and sampling the honey, 'ngampij' or 'ngapinykarra'. A stick or small brush which is used to get honey out of a tree that cannot be chopped open is called a 'jamawurn'.

If pregant women eats emu, the baby might get sick. They also cannot eat barramundi because something might get stuck in the baby's throat and cause it to swell up. Goannas with eggs are also not good for pregnant women because they may cause their babies to be born with sores. Pregnant women also should not eat bush turkey in case the child's throat drops and swells up in the same way that bush turkeys' throats do when they are dancing or fighting. Echidnas are also not good for pregnant women. If they eat them the prickles might cripple the foetus. Pregnant women should also not eat turtle because their babies might end up waddling instead of walking properly. Pregnant women also cannot be present around cooking meat.

Older fruits become hard and chewy and they may be softened by lightly roasting on hot coals. The flowers can also be eaten. The leaves are called 'pinti' or 'yurtu'. They are good for you and are like eating cabbage or lettuce.

\ee Mosquitoes are often active at dawn and dusk and they suck your 'kungulu' (blood). They can be chased away by lighting a smoky fire or by placing dry manure from horses or cattle on the coals. The smoke from burning 'manyingila' (gutta-percha) and 'ngamanpurru' (conkerberry) is especially good for repelling mosquitoes. The activity of mosquitoes, including their noise and bite, is referred to as 'ngiing'.

\ee Jungkuwurru often live in rocky country, where they hide in crevasses and cracks. Their homes are called 'ngurlunyjurna'. They can be pulled out with wire hooks or hooked branches. They are much more commonly seen at night when they walk around looking for food. They are most active during full moon periods in the cold weather of the dry season. Night hunting for echidna is called 'waramarla'. When they walk they leave a little track where the prickles drag along the ground. When they are approached, they roll into a tight ball to protect themselves. Their favourite foods are 'pingi' (ants) and 'munkurt' (termites) which they eat with their 'jalany' (tongue). They are often found near termite mounds called 'tamarra'. During the hot weather of the build-up they can be found in cool areas near 'lamarn' (rivers), where they look for wet ground that is cool to sleep on. The name 'Jungkuwurru' is derived from Jaminjung (jungku=point of elbow plus -wurru=having). Porcupines or echidnas are also often called 'paka-yawung' (having spikes). Large echidnas are called 'purnukangu'. Echidnas are eaten. The meat is sweet like pork. It has a lot of tasty white coloured fat. You need to chop off the spines and feet prior to cooking the whole body in a ground oven. You can soften the spines by placing them on hot coals for a short time or by placing them in a bucket of very hot water. The flesh cannot be eaten by young boys and mothers during initiation ceremonies. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) cannot eat them because the spikes might poke the baby and it will be born a cripple. It can be eaten after a 'needle' from them is hammered into a 'wanyarri' or 'jingi' (bauhinia tree). They are a Dreaming or totem for some people who cannot eat them. There is an important Dreamtime or creation period story about Jungkuwurru that relates to how he got his prickles. Jungkuwurru got mad when he found out that the other animals weren't giving him the good beef. He took all the shade trees away, but the other animals speared him, giving him his prickles.

\ee You can use the ashes mixed with 'tamarra' (termite mound) to treat babies. You lie the baby down on a layer of this mix and more is piled around the baby and firmly pressed against the arms, chest, throat, hips, lower back and legs. The child's legs are straightened as the hot mix is applied. This procedure, called 'kamparnup' (cooking) has the effect of closing the baby's 'ngamany' (fontanelle) and strengthening the baby's legs in preparation for 'kalu' (walking). Adults with sore joints are also treated this way. You can also use the 'ngarlaka' (seeds) to treat small children. You boil the seeds and make babies sit in the liquid. It makes their legs strong, helping them to start walking. The hard timber makes good 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). In the past, people made 'yarnarnti' (ashes) from burning the leaves. These ashes were mixed with tobacco and chewed.

It holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. These kangaroos sometimes have a distinctive 'pungkurl' (humped back) and are called 'wanyil' or 'kakuya'. They can be roasted in a ground oven and eaten, but do not taste very good. The 'kampun' (tendons) from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers).

\ee In the past the scalps were collected and sold to the police as part of control program. Pastoralists often put out poisonous baits near waterholes to kill wild dingoes so that they don't harm cattle. People in the old days used to keep them as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and other lizards. They were very good at finding game, but they would also kill animals at stations such as chooks and goats. Wild dingoes breed in the cold weather time of the dry season. They are often heard howling at night when it is cold.

\ee Bandicoots are like large rats with long pointy noses. They are ground dwellers which dig little holes looking for food. During the day they hide in grassy areas where they make small camps in thick grass. They have not been seen in recent times but in the past they were common sometimes and then would not be seen for a while. Following good wet seasons and lots of rain, they would be seen in large numbers, especially near 'lamarn' (rivers). The meat is very tasty and tender. When bandicoots were common, they were hunted often. They are more common in northern areas.

\ee This Dreaming snake lives in deep waterholes. It comes out sometimes during very heavy rain events. When 'pulngayit' (floodwaters) come, it may move to another waterhole. Ngurrkpana gets angry when it hears another language being spoken and the water where it lives may begin to bubble. If it is disturbed, there will be heavy rains and flooding. Ngurrkpana has a number of messengers including 'karrmaninmanin' or 'mungku' (red-faced turtle) and 'wajpinya' (little water goanna). Their eggs and the animals themselves are left alone for fear of aggravating Ngurrkpana. Baby rainbow spirits are called 'kawurrwarang' or 'lawirtawirta'.

\ee Jungkuwurru often live in rocky country, where they hide in crevasses and cracks. Their homes are called 'ngurlunyjurna'. They can be pulled out with wire hooks or hooked branches. They are much more commonly seen at night when they walk around looking for food. They are most active during full moon periods in the cold weather of the dry season. Night hunting for echidna is called 'waramarla'. When they walk they leave a little track where the prickles drag along the ground. When they are approached, they roll into a tight ball to protect themselves. Their favourite foods are 'pingi' (ants) and 'munkurt' (termites) which they eat with their 'jalany' (tongue). They are often found near termite mounds called 'tamarra'. During the hot weather of the build-up they can be found in cool areas near 'lamarn' (rivers), where they look for wet ground that is cool to sleep on. The name 'Jungkuwurru' is derived from Jaminjung (jungku=point of elbow plus -wurru=having). Porcupines or echidnas are also often called 'paka-yawung' (having spikes). Large echidnas are called 'purnukangu'. Echidnas are eaten. The meat is sweet like pork. It has a lot of tasty white coloured fat. You need to chop off the spines and feet prior to cooking the whole body in a ground oven. You can soften the spines by placing them on hot coals for a short time or by placing them in a bucket of very hot water. The flesh cannot be eaten by young boys and mothers during initiation ceremonies. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) cannot eat them because the spikes might poke the baby and it will be born a cripple. It can be eaten after a 'needle' from them is hammered into a 'wanyarri' or 'jingi' (bauhinia tree). They are a Dreaming or totem for some people who cannot eat them. There is an important Dreamtime or creation period story about Jungkuwurru that relates to how he got his prickles. Jungkuwurru got mad when he found out that the other animals weren't giving him the good beef. He took all the shade trees away, but the other animals speared him, giving him his prickles.

\ee This word is from Mudburra and Warlpiri. Bandicoots are like large rats with long pointy noses. They are ground dwellers which dig little holes looking for food. During the day they hide in grassy areas where they make small camps in thick grass. They have not been seen in recent times but in the past they were common sometimes and then would not be seen for a while. Following good wet seasons and lots of rain, they would be seen in large numbers, especially near 'lamarn' (rivers). The meat is very tasty and tender. When bandicoots were common, they were hunted often. They are more common in northern areas.

\ee This is a Malngin word. These turtles have a hard bite and must be handled carefully. They are common in the 'pinka' (creeks)  and 'langkarna' (billabongs). This is the most commonly eaten turtle. It is generally caught on 'wuyurrun' (hand-lines), although you can also catch them by hand. The meat is very tasty and highly sought after.  You slit their throat and cook them upside down. They are then salted and eaten from the shell. The meat stews in the blood and juices making it tasty. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) should not eat turtle because their babies might end up waddling instead of learning to walk properly.

\ee Bandicoots are like large rats with long pointy noses. They are ground dwellers which dig little holes looking for food. During the day they hide in grassy areas where they make small camps in thick grass. They have not been seen in recent times but in the past they were common sometimes and then would not be seen for a while. Following good wet seasons and lots of rain, they would be seen in large numbers, especially near 'lamarn' (rivers). The meat is very tasty and tender. When bandicoots were common, they were hunted often. They are more common in northern areas.

\ee This small hunting bird can hover in one place for long periods looking for prey. You often see them hovering at the start of the cold weather.
There is a Dreaming story about two 'kurrarntal' (brolgas)  who lived near Kunawa (Cattle Creek station). The sisters who had the skin name Nampijina were digging for 'kamara' (yams) on a large blacksoil plain. They kept the good yams for themselves and wouldn't give any to their Japarta grandsons, who were 'palinypaliny' (kestrels). So the Japartas flew overhead and landed on the eastside of the plain and made a fire. One of the 'palinypaliny' took the fire west and the two 'kurrarntal' (brolgas) were unable to escape and were burnt. As they burnt to death, they huddled together, one on top of the other. Now two rocks can be found in their place.

\ee This tree bears edible nuts called 'timpi' or 'janyparlk', though they are often just called 'partiki'. The big nuts are called 'mirtamirta'. Peanuts and other introduced nuts are also called 'partiki'. When the nuts are ripe, they are broken open and the seed inside is eaten. In the old days the fruit were cracked open with the back of a 'warlmayi' (spear-thrower). Now an axe or hammer is used. The leaves are also used to treat 'marntara' (skin sores) and 'karlapa' (boils), in conjunction with 'wariyili'. The leaves are boiled until the mix goes green, then the sores and boils are bathed in it. The mixture helps draw the pus out. It is also good for toothaches and can be used as shampoo which makes hair dark and healthy. The timber makes good 'warlu' (firewood) and it is common to find 'namawurru' or 'ngarlu' (sugarbag) in the trunk. The outer bark produces 'wuyu' (fine black soot) when it is burnt. This can be used as colour during ceremonies. In the past the soot was rubbed onto the skin of light-skinned babies so that the welfare officers would not take them away.

\ee Eel-tail catfish used to be caught with a spinifex bundle used as a 'warni' (fish net) or with a 'mirlarrang' (spear). They generally do not take bait on a 'wuyurrun' (hand-line). The larger ones can be roasted and eaten. The smaller ones are used as bait to catch larger fish such as 'manyirrkirla' (barramundi). These eel-tail catfish also have dangerous spines that must be carefully avoided. 'Marnpa' is the term used for young catfish without spikes, while 'kinyang' refers to the larger catfish with dangerous spines. These fish often eat small stones that look like the fruit of 'partiki' (nut trees) and the name 'partikipany' refers to this. This fish is also dangerous and can be used in sorcery. Drawing the fish on the cliffs of Seale Gorge at Parlngarrawuny will harm someone magically.

\ee To make fire, a straight, smooth, narrow stem is cut to about 40 cm long, and a broader heavier piece is cut and a small round hole with a vee carved into it. One end of the narrow stick is placed in the hole of the heavier stick. The narrow stick is then rotated quickly between the palms with a strong downward pressure. This 'drilling' creates friction which in turn creates a very hot, fine dust. This dust pours down the vee carved into the wood onto a clump of fine, dry grass previously placed underneath. The grass and the very hot dust are gently blown upon until flame appears.

\ee Barramundi can get large and are hard to catch as they fight hard to get off the line. They are common in billabongs and the big rivers. They are mostly caught using live bait on 'wuyurrun' (hand-lines). The flesh is roasted on hot coals, a cooking technique called 'wupkarra'. Yinarrwa has the skin name Nalyirri. Small barramundi are called 'marna' and large ones are called 'pirlapirla'. Pregnant women cannot eat barramundi because something might get stuck in the baby's throat and cause it to swell up. If an expectant father kills a barramundi, the spirit of the fish might go into the pregnant woman and the child. Alternatively if an expectant father catches a barramundi, the child might be born with a 'nawun' (mark). For example, if the man rips the lip of the barramundi taking out the hook, the child may be born with a harelip.

'Warrpawurru' (flying-foxes) and 'lanu' (bees) visit the flowers to get nectar and pollen. The papery bark can be used to make 'palkiny' (blankets) and shelters for the wet season. Children also used to make 'karukirlikirlaj' (dolls) from the bark in the old days.

It lives in rocky areas, especially in 'jarriny' (caves and crevasses). There is a song which stops the poison if you are bitten by this snake. There are also songs which clear snakes away from camping areas. When they are killed they are chopped into pieces and burnt on a fire until they turn to ash, otherwise they can sing themselves back to life and will chase you and kill you.

The smoke from burning 'manyingila' (gutta-percha) and 'ngamanpurru' (conkerberry) is especially good for repelling mosquitoes. The activity of mosquitoes, including their noise and bite, is referred to as 'ngiing'.

It lives in rocky areas, especially in 'jarriny' (caves and crevasses). There is a song which stops the poison if you are bitten by this snake. There are also songs which clear snakes away from camping areas. When they are killed they are chopped into pieces and burnt on a fire until they turn to ash, otherwise they can sing themselves back to health and will chase you and kill you.

\ee Jungkuwurru often live in rocky country, where they hide in crevasses and cracks. Their homes are called 'ngurlunyjurna'. They can be pulled out with wire hooks or hooked branches. They are much more commonly seen at night when they walk around looking for food. They are most active during full moon periods in the cold weather of the dry season. Night hunting for echidna is called 'waramarla'. When they walk they leave a little track where the prickles drag along the ground. When they are approached, they roll into a tight ball to protect themselves. Their favourite foods are 'pingi' (ants) and 'munkurt' (termites) which they eat with their 'jalany' (tongue). They are often found near termite mounds called 'tamarra'. During the hot weather of the build-up they can be found in cool areas near 'lamarn' (rivers), where they look for wet ground that is cool to sleep on. The name 'Jungkuwurru' is derived from Jaminjung (jungku=point of elbow plus -wurru=having). Porcupines or echidnas are also often called 'paka-yawung' (having spikes). Large echidnas are called 'purnukangu'. Echidnas are eaten. The meat is sweet like pork. It has a lot of tasty white coloured fat. You need to chop off the spines and feet prior to cooking the whole body in a ground oven. You can soften the spines by placing them on hot coals for a short time or by placing them in a bucket of very hot water. The flesh cannot be eaten by young boys and mothers during initiation ceremonies. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) cannot eat them because the spikes might poke the baby and it will be born a cripple. It can be eaten after a 'needle' from them is hammered into a 'wanyarri' or 'jingi' (bauhinia tree). They are a Dreaming or totem for some people who cannot eat them. There is an important Dreamtime or creation period story about Jungkuwurru that relates to how he got his prickles. Jungkuwurru got mad when he found out that the other animals weren't giving him the good beef. He took all the shade trees away, but the other animals speared him, giving him his prickles.

\ee Termite mounds are used in bush medicine. The fine soil from inside the ant hill is used to treat 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The inner soil is heated on a fire and then added to water and mixed with 'warrwa' ashes. You let the grass bits settle out before you drink it. Heated antbed is also used to treat or 'cook' babies. The antbed is crushed and mixed with 'ngirirri' ash. Newborns are slathered with this warm wet mix to close their fontanelles and strengthen their bodies. Mothers with newborn babies also add water to this mix and drink it to promote their milk. Around the age of one, mothers 'cook'  babies' lower backs and legs in the same mixture to help them start walking. You can also put antbed on a fire with water and the baby is held in the smoke and steam. This makes sure the baby physically strong in later life. You can also use antbed with other bush medicines including 'warlayara'. 'Warlayara' is added to the wet slurry after the antbed has been heated up. This is a dryer mixture. You can also find 'nangkalij' (ground sugarbag) in termite mounds, especially the large rounded mounds. You can also find 'jungkuwurru' (porcupines or echidnas) camped in the holes in termite mounds. They like to eat the 'munkurt' (termites) inside. In the past the larger mounds were hollowed out in the centre and you could sit in them during heavy rain periods and stay dry.

It is often quite small and used as bait to catch bigger fish, especially 'yinarrwa' or 'manyirrkila' (barramundi). The larger ones can be roasted on hot coals, a cooking technique called 'wupkarra'. The meat is very tasty. Sometimes the flesh contains small worms, especially when the fish are in small waterholes. They need to be well cooked to kill the worms.

\ee This tree has very hard wood. The timber of large trees can be used to make 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). The straight stems of young trees can be used to make 'kiyarri' (digging-sticks), 'kuturu' (fighting-sticks) and 'mirta' (shields). The wood can also be used to carve message-sticks. Dry stems and branches can be used to carry fire from one place to another. They can be lit at one end and will slowly smoulder along their length. Occasionally they will need to be blown on to keep them alight.

\pc freshwater_croc.jpg
\ee The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks). The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, you followed the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs are ready to be collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs are ready to be collected are when 'purrju' (march flies) start biting. There is an important Gurindji Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who loved at Liyapirri near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

It is often quite small and used as bait to catch bigger fish, especially 'yinarrwa' or 'manyirrkila' (barramundi). The larger ones can be roasted on hot coals, a cooking technique called 'wupkarra'.

\ee This is a Bilinarra and Ngarinyman word. The leaves are used in bush medicine. You boil the new leaves until the water goes cloudy. The liquid is used as a wash to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol), skin problems and 'kulyurrk' (coughs). A small amount may also be drunk to treat coughs. This liquid has a good smell like Vicks. The leaves may also be placed on a burnt down fire to produce smoke. The patient is then rubbed with 'wararr' (fat) and treated with the smoke. This heals the person by passing the smell of the tree over them. Babies and small children are held over the smoking leaves. The leaves can also be used as fish poison. Small branches and twigs are thrown into small waterholes, or the branches are dragged through the water. The fish become dazed and float to the surface, where they can be easily collected. The leaves can also be added to meat being cooked in a ground oven. They keep the meat moist and give the meat a good flavour. 'Ngimal' (small leafy branches) can also be spread on the ground to keep meat clean while it is being prepared and after it is cooked. 'Ngarlu' (sugarbag) can be found in this tree. The wood also makes good 'warlu' (firewood). 'Lamawurt' (witchetty grubs) can also be found in the lower trunk of this tree. The sugar-leaf, a sweet edible insect, collected from this tree is called 'purrngun'.

\ee This is a Malngin word. The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks) . The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, people would follow the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs were collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs were ready to be collected was when 'purrju' (march flies) started biting. There is a Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who lived at Liyapiti near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

The meat can also be boiled in water with a little salt and made into 'yingalk' (soup) and this can be drunk to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) and 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The juice from mussels can also be used to treat ear aches and infections. It is dripped straight into the ear.

The meat can also be boiled in water with a little salt and made into 'yingalk' (soup) and this can be drunk to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) and 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The juice from mussels can also be used to treat ear aches and infections. It is dripped straight into the 'langa' (ear).

\ee These white grubs live in tree trunks and roots of bloodwoods, 'marlan' or the red river gum, and wattle species such as 'mulurrmi', 'kirrpirli', 'pirrpun' and 'puntarrji'. Witchetty grubs are spotted by looking for the entrance hole with associated 'puntu' or fine dust or 'kura' or excrement on the trunk and branches. The wood is then chopped just above the hole to widen it, and the grub pulled out with a piece of thin hooked wire or a hooked stick called a 'narra'. This process is called 'wililip'. They can be eaten raw or lightly cooked in hot ashes. They taste like scrambled eggs and are much sought after. They can also be used as bait when fishing.

\ee Bauhinas have a number of uses. The inner red bark makes good medicine. You can boil it and use the water as a wash and drink to treat 'warrngun' (headaches), 'kulykulya' (colds) and 'marntara' (skin sores). You can also chew the leaves to treat colds. You also find 'namawurru' (sugarbag) in this tree. The red flowers can be sucked to get the sweet nectar. The seed pods are called 'ngapirlipirli'. You can burn the bark to make 'kawurn' (tobacco ashes). You can chew the leaves if you are thirsty. Chewing the leaves helps produce 'jawul' (saliva) and stops the feeling of intense thirst.

\ee Emus are not seen much near Kalkaringi, but they are plentiful in some bush areas on Gurindji country. Emus eat many of the bush tucker fruit that people also eat. They also eat many insects. In the early days people hunted them with 'mirlarrang' (spears) and 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). If a spear missed, a boomerang would be thrown at the legs to make it fall down. Hunters also waited for them at billabongs where they knelt to drink. They were easy targets then. When killed, emus are gutted and the 'karnngirri' (guts) are throw away, but the 'tulang' (heart), 'marlumpa' (liver) and 'wararr' (fat) can be put back in for cooking. The bird is then cooked in a ground oven using a method called 'turturl', with 'kuruwarrany' (hot stones) placed inside the gut cavity, then covered with paperbark to keep the meat clean. The meat is dark and smells strong. You can also eat the eggs. Baby emus are called 'wininiwinini', a family of emus is called 'warnangaliny' and the feathers of an emu are called 'wanya'. A number of major Dreaming tracks associated with Yiparrartu go through Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

\ee This nail-tail wallaby has a distinctive 'pungkurl' (humped back). Like all nail-tail wallabies, it has a prickle in the end of its tail and often makes a 'oo..oo..oo' noise when it is hopping. There is a special song that it sings as it hops along. It also holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. The flesh can be roasted and eaten, but it does not taste very good and is rarely eaten. The 'kampun' (tendons) from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers). Wanyil is a character in a story. She lived with her sister Yawarlwarl (Pigeon) at Kurlungurru (Riveren) which is in Nyininy country. The two sisters owned a grindstone. Wanyil was very careful with the grindstone and wouldn't let Yawarlwarl use it. But Wanyil would only half-grind the seed which annoyed Yawarlwarl. At one point Wanyil went to get some water and Yawarlwarl took the opportunity to steal the stone. She carried it off, camping overnight at Pirlingkalurlungka. She then went on to Yawarlwarl where she placed the stone upright. You can still see the stone there to this day.

One story about 'warlawurru' is that if a young black eagle sees a murderer, the murderer will live for a long time. But if an old light eagle that sees the murderer, he will die soon. There is also a Dreaming story about Warlawurru (Eagle) and Jarlwa (Heron) which begins with Warlawurru stealing and eating the Jarlwa's sister. In revenge, Jarlwa lures Warlawurru into a cave. Jarlwa builds a fire at the entrance of the cave hoping to suffocate Warlawurru. But Warlawurru escapes, gathers a war party and attacks Jarlwa's family.

When they are pulled on to land they often make a grunting noise. The spines or prickles on the fins are dangerous. They contain poison and can cause severe pain and swelling. You should break off the spines and burn them on the fire, throw them back in the water or put them in a safe place. If you step on the spine, you should slap the area with the tail of the fish. This stops the pain and swelling. You can also treat the area of the sting with urine from the catfish or place hot sand on it.

The spines should be broken off and burnt on the fire, thrown in the water or placed in a safe place. If you step on a spine then you can slap the area with the tail of the fish to stop the pain and swelling. You can also treat the area of the sting with urine from the catfish or place hot sand on it. Small or baby catfish are called 'ngirnngirta', 'ngikngikkaji' or 'katang'.

\pc freshwater_croc.jpg
\ee The name 'lirrayawung' or 'kangarntayawung' refers to their big teeth. The place where you find crocodiles is called 'panyjawiti'. In the past men used to hunt them with spears with stone points. Divers or 'tarukpin' used to hunt them underwater. The crocodile was then cooked by cutting open the stomach from under the front leg, down the side and under the stomach. The 'lupu' (intestines) were then removed from the gut cavity. This was then filled with 'kuruwarrany' (heated rocks) . The body and tail were then roasted in hot coals in a cooking process called 'wupkarra' or cooked in a ground oven called 'turturl'. The meat was skinned or 'puruny' before eating. The 'yilinginyjarr' (tail meat) is the tastiest part. Female crocodiles are called 'purruyurl' and baby crocodiles are called 'laking'. The mother crocodile sometimes takes these babies from the nest in the sand to the water by carrying them in her mouth. The 'kampij' (eggs) were also eaten in the past. To get the eggs, people would follow the tracks of the mother to the nest, dug the sand out and collected the eggs. The eggs were then boiled or cooked in hot sand. The eggs were collected during the hot weather time when the 'jangarla' tree produces its large white flowers. Another indication that the eggs were ready to be collected was when 'purrju' (march flies) started biting. There is a Dreaming story about Warrija (Crocodile) and Kirrawa (Goanna) who lived at Liyapiti near Warrijkuny (Sambo Rockhole). At that time Kirrawa was able to dive underwater and Warrija was not. He wanted to be able to dive so Kirrawa fetched some 'martiya' (bush gum) and put them along his back and tail. Warrija was able to dive deep underwater then. He left his friend Kirrawa forever who then become a land-dweller.

\ee The Warrija Kirrawa (Crocodile and Goanna) story is based here. The story begins with Kirrawa as a water creature and Warrija as an animal who could only float. Warrija envies Kirrawa's ability to dive deep into the water. Kirrawa feels sorry for his friend and collects some martiya (bush gum) and sticks it to Warrija's back and tail. He creates the ridges you can see on crocodiles today. Warrija finds he can now dive deeply and leaves his friend to live in the depths of the river. Before he leaves, he tells Kirrawa to learn to become a bush animal, and so he does.

The termite mound is heated up and mixed with water and then the 'warrwa' is added. Children are then slathered with the mixture and given it to drink. The wax found at the base of the plant is called 'warraaj' or 'jikala'. You collect it, melt and pound it a number of times to create a strong glue used with 'kampun' (kangaroo tendons) to bind spear or axe heads to their shafts.

The meat is roasted and eaten and is very tasty. The 'kampun' (tendons) from the tails are used to attach 'yalka' (spear heads) or 'kurrwa' (axe heads) to shafts, and 'narra' (hooks) to 'warlmaya' (spear-throwers). They occur most commonly in the southern areas and but also sometimes occur near Kunawa (Cattle Creek) and Yingawunarri (Top Springs). They are common in the Lajamanu area and other places in the Tanami Desert.

\ee This short, solid mussel is found in the mud at the edges of 'langkarna' (billabongs). They are roasted on hot coals and eaten. Mussels cannot be eaten by boys; men can only eat them after they have been initiated. The meat can also be boiled in water with a little salt and made into 'yingalk' (soup) and this can be drunk to treat 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) and 'ngajkula' (diarrhoea). The juice from mussels can also be used to treat ear aches and infections. It is dripped straight into the 'langa' (ear).

\ee The small black and white seeds look like sand and in the past the seeds were made into 'mangarri' (small dampers). The plant is small and it grows along the ground. The whole plant can be placed onto a 'kawarla' (coolamon) and the seeds are winnowed out and collected. When enough are available, they are ground up using a 'jungari' (grinding stone). The flour is then mixed with water and made into small dampers. These are lightly cooked then eaten. Dampers are very good food and in the past it was an important food source, however, making the food was hard work. The seeds are also eaten by cockatoos.

The general term for pinkys or kangaroo fetuses is 'pilyily'. Little children should not hold them because they might develop bad knees. Larger joeys that have hair and are still getting in and out of the pouch are 'wulungarna' or 'wartangarna', referring to how they follow around their mothers legs. The pouch is called 'puul'.

\ee This plant grows on 'palangari' (black soil plains) that get very water-logged in the wet season. The yams are good to eat and are long like sweet potatoes. They are large types of 'kamara'. The yam may be dug up easily as they are not very deep and the black soil is easy to dig. They are best dug up soon after the wet season finishes when the soil is still soft. They are eaten after a short roasting in hot coals. In the old days, the small sweet and tasty yams were called 'julu' which also refers to navels. These days the young yams are called 'pilyilya', which is a more general word for anything young. These are like baby carrots and are probably the first year tubers that are tender.

The dry stems are burnt down to 'wuyu' (charcoal) which is mixed with 'wararr' (fat) and painted on the body for dancing.

\ee This small kangaroo lives in rocky areas. There are a lot in the sandstone areas near Daguragu. They often shelter in caves in the hot weather time. They are very timid and are not often seen. They hop around very quickly and are difficult to spear. In the past they were hunted by finding the paths they travel on and setting a hunter with a stick to wait. Other hunters would scare the rock wallaby so that it hopped down the track towards the other hunter who would hit it hard with the stick. They were then roasted and eaten, though there is not much meat as they are quite small. This kangaroo is different from 'minawut'.

\ee This tree is used in bush medicine. You can dab the white sap onto 'marntara' (skin sores) to help them heal. You can also boil the bark and leaves and use the liquid to treat itchy skin and 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol) . The fruit is also edible, but some people do not eat the fruit when they are brown. 'Yawu' (fish) and 'narrinyjila' (turtles) also eat the fruit when they fall in the water. 'Wirnangpurru' (kangaroos) eat the fruit when they fall on the ground. The straight dry stems are used to make fire-sticks or bush matches to light a fire using the traditional drilling or friction method. These fire-sticks were carried everywhere and could be used many times. In the wet season they were wrapped in paperbark to keep them dry. A straight, smooth, narrow stem is cut to about 40 cm long, and a broader heavier piece is cut and a small round hole with a vee carved into it. One end of the narrow stick is placed in the hole of the heavier stick. The narrow stick is then rotated quickly between the palms with a strong downward pressure. This drilling called 'pinyinyip' creates friction which in turn creates a very hot, fine dust. This dust pours down the vee carved into the wood onto a clump of fine, dry grass previously placed underneath. The grass and the very hot dust are gently blown upon until flame appears.

The roots and bulbs crack the ground above them, these 'ngurnta' (cracks) can be followed to find large yams below.

\ee Stems and branches that have been hollowed by termites and are of the appropriate diameter can be made into 'kulumpung' (didgeridoos). 'Namawurru' or 'ngarlu' (sugarbag) can be found in this tree too. Timber from young plants can be use to make 'kuturu' (fighting sticks) or 'warlmayi' (spear-throwers). The bark is burnt to 'kawurn' (fine white ash) to mix with 'warlayarra' (tobacco).

\so McConvell
\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag is considered a mild laxative which 'opens up' your stomach. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalij' or 'nangkaliny' or 'yarlukura'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngarlu' or 'namawurru'. The entrance hole of the hive is called 'jurrkiny' which has a nose or veranda over the hole. The small stingless bee is called 'nama' or 'lanu'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kuntarri', 'kumpaying' or 'ngunyuwulij'. The wax is called 'jikala', 'piyarnak', or 'tarla'. The separation between the honey and wax, and the pollen is called 'jirnuk'. The honey, wax and pollen all mixed up together is referred to as 'kirrang'. A full hive is called 'ngitiwuny'. The egg of the bee is called 'kurla'. Bee droppings are called 'jayurrk' and are seen below the hive entrance holes on the ground. This signals that the hive is active. The word for sugarbag season is 'tulwarrangkarrakmirntij' (the season of blossoms) and there are specific words for chopping at a tree to get honey, 'pirntirrp' or 'tarlawurlp' and digging into the hole with your fingers and sampling the honey, 'ngampij' or 'ngapinykarra'. A stick or small brush which is used to get honey out of a tree that cannot be chopped open is called a 'jamawurn'.

\ee In the past, camels were seen at Victoria River Downs Station and Jinparrak or Wave Hill Station. They were used to carry heavy loads from the depot at Timber Creek via Yukayawung (Mount Sanford) and Bullita. They were very strong and could carry much heavier loads than donkeys and mules. Sometimes they were driven by Afghan cameleers called 'mutura'. Camels used to have pegs put through their noses to lead them around. They could be very 'kuliyan' (aggressive). Two Afghan traders called Ajarraman and Walyji lived at Wave Hill settlement (now Kalkaringi) in the early days. They had a shop on the side of the hill opposite the site of the current shop. The Afghan who had a shop at Limbunya was called Palyung or Charlie. He had a Gurindji wife. Camels now occur as feral animals further to the south in Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

Yawarlwarl is also a character in a Dreamtime story. She lived with her sister Wanyil (Wallaby) at Kurlungurru (Riveren) which is in Nyininy country. The two sisters owned a grindstone. Wanyil was very careful with the grindstone and wouldn't let Yawarlwarl use it. But Wanyil would only half-grind the seed which annoyed Yawarlwarl. At one point Wanyil went to get some water and Yawarlwarl took the opportunity to steal the stone. She carried it off, camping overnight at Pirlingkalurlungka. She then went on to Yawarlwarl where she placed the stone upright. You can still see the stone there to this day.

\ee This is a Bilinarra or Ngarinyman word, but is often used in Gurindji. Barramundi can get large and are hard to catch as they fight hard to get off the line. They are common in billabongs and the big rivers. They are mostly caught using live bait on 'wuyurrun' (hand-lines). The flesh is roasted on hot coals, a cooking technique called 'wupkarra'. Yinarrwa has the skin name Nalyirri. Small barramundi are called 'marna' and large ones are called 'pirlapirla'.
\ee Pregnant women cannot eat barramundi because something might get stuck in the baby's throat and cause it to swell up. If an expectant father kills a barramundi, the spirit of the fish might go into the pregnant woman and the child. Alternatively if an expectant father catches a barramundi, the child might be born with a birthmark (nawun). For example, if the man rips the lip of the barramundi taking out the hook, the child may be born with a harelip.

\ee Emus are not seen much near Kalkaringi, but they are plentiful in some bush areas on Gurindji country. Emus eat many of the bush tucker fruit that people also eat. They also eat many insects. In the early days people hunted them with 'mirlarrang' (spears) and 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). If a spear missed, a boomerang would be thrown at the legs to make it fall down. Hunters also waited for them at billabongs where they knelt to drink. They were easy targets then. When killed, emus are gutted and the 'karnngirri' (guts) are throw away, but the 'tulang' (heart), 'marlumpa' (liver) and 'wararr' (fat) can be put back in for cooking. The bird is then cooked in a ground oven using a method called 'turturl', with 'kuruwarrany' (hot stones) placed inside the gut cavity, then covered with paperbark to keep the meat clean. The meat is dark and smells strong. You can also eat the eggs. Baby emus are called 'wininiwinini', a family of emus is called 'warnangaliny' and the feathers of an emu are called 'wanya'. A number of major Dreaming tracks associated with Yiparrartu go through Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

They are cooked in the same way as the black-headed python and can get very large and have a lot of meat that tastes similar to goanna flesh. This snake has links with Kurraj (Rainbow Spirit) which also lives in deep waterholes. In the Dreaming, this snake is known as 'japartajaparta' because it has the Japarta skin. There is a Dreaming site is on Wardaman country near Willeroo to the north, but it is well known to Gurindji people.

The leaves and branches are strong smelling. They are also very sticky which is why 'yirrijkaji' is sometimes called 'nangkaji' (something which is sticky). You can use the leaves and branches as medicine. You boil them up and use the mixture to treat 'marntara' (skin sores), 'warrngun' (headaches) and 'kulykulya' (congestion or 'bad cold' in Kriol). Alternatively the leaves of 'lawa', 'yirrijkaji' and 'marlarn' can be layered into a fire pit which has burnt down. Children are held over the pit to inhale the smoke and allow it to waft over their skin. The timber can be used to make spear points because the wood is very hard.

\ee In the past, camels were seen at Victoria River Downs Station and Jinparrak or Wave Hill Station. They were used to carry heavy loads from the depot at Timber Creek via Yukayawung (Mount Sanford) and Bullita. They were very strong and could carry much heavier loads than donkeys and mules. Sometimes they were driven by Afghan cameleers called 'mutura'. Camels used to have pegs put through their noses to lead them around. They could be very 'kuliyan' (aggressive). Two Afghan traders called Ajarraman and Walyji lived at Wave Hill settlement (now Kalkaringi) in the early days. They had a shop on the side of the hill opposite the site of the current shop. The Afghan who had a shop at Limbunya was called Palyung or Charlie. He had a Gurindji wife. Camels now occur as feral animals further to the south in Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

\ee This word is from Malngin or Nyininy. The fruit go a slightly orange-yellow colour when they ripen. The fruit are sweet and very tasty. The unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help ripen them which might take as long as two weeks. The wood can be used as 'warlu' (firewood) as it lights quickly and easily. When the fruit are ripe they have a strong pleasant smell, which can be noticed from a long way from the plant. This ripe and strong smelling fruit is called 'mawukarl' or 'kirnti'. The bark can be used as medicine for scabies. It is chipped off the trunk, crushed into small pieces and boiled in water and the cooled liquid is used as an external wash to treat scabies. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season come this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is wafted towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

\ee Bush turkeys are one of the best bush foods. They are commonly found on grassy plain areas and there are lots near Kalkaringi. They were hunted with 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs) in the past. Now 'turlakkaji' (rifles) are used. You can boil or roast the meat in a ground oven, a cooking method called 'turturl'. The cooked meat tastes like chicken. 'Ngarturr' (pregnant women) can't eat the meat in case their children are born with bad throats such that they will talk in a husky manner. Little kids shouldn't eat bush turkey for the same reason. When they are carrying eggs, they are not hunted. Female bush turkeys are called 'kuwarlang' and the chicks are called 'ngamarti'. The large males are called 'kirtakirta'. They make a noise in their throat called 'juwarra' or 'parrngart' when they are courting and mating. They like to eat grasshoppers and insects and many types of bush fruits. 'Warlawurru' (wedge-tailed eagles) sometimes catch 'jamut' and eat them.

\ee Emus are not seen much near Kalkaringi, but they are plentiful in some bush areas on Gurindji country. Emus eat many of the bush tucker fruit that people also eat. They also eat many insects. In the early days people hunted them with 'mirlarrang' (spears) and 'kurrupartu' (boomerangs). If a spear missed, a boomerang would be thrown at the legs to make it fall down. Hunters also waited for them at billabongs where they knelt to drink. They were easy targets then. When killed, emus are gutted and the 'karnngirri' (guts) are throw away, but the 'tulang' (heart), 'marlumpa' (liver) and 'wararr' (fat) can be put back in for cooking. The bird is then cooked in a ground oven using a method called 'turturl', with 'kuruwarrany' (hot stones) placed inside the gut cavity, then covered with paperbark to keep the meat clean. The meat is dark and smells strong. You can also eat the eggs. Baby emus are called 'wininiwinini', a family of emus is called 'warnangaliny' and the feathers of an emu are called 'wanya'. A number of major Dreaming tracks associated with Yiparrartu go through Bilinarra and Gurindji country.

It lives in rocky areas, especially in 'jarriny' (caves and crevasses). There is a song which stops the poison if you are bitten by this snake. There are also songs which clear snakes away from camping areas. When they are killed they are chopped into pieces and burnt on a fire until they turn to ash, otherwise they can sing themselves back to health and will chase you and kill you.
