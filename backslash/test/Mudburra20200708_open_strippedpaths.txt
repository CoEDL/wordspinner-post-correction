Additionally, for the first few years after the initiation, the young man's sisters and female cousins can refer to him as 'yirrimaka'. Some people also follow these same restrictions with their classificatory siblings - that is, with everyone who is of the right skin group regardless of any biological relationship.

The ripe fruit are sweet and very tasty, and they have a pleasant fruity smell that you can smell from a long way off. The leaves can be used to make bush tobacco, which was chewed in the past, mixed with ashes called 'buna' to enhance the taste. This plant has small sharp thorns and usually grows up the trunks of trees, especially bauhinias and bulwaddy.

\ee This plant has pretty pink flowers and grows in red plains country. The yams are dug up and eaten; they have an excellent taste and can often be collected in large numbers. The yams can be eaten lightly roasted or boiled. The root system of this plant is expansive and the yams are usually found quite far from the plant. People locate them by looking for cracks in the ground: the roots and bulbs often crack the ground above them. These cracks can be followed to find large yams below. The yams can also be found by tapping the ground around the plant with a digging stick. If a hollow noise is heard, it indicates a large yam is below and it is a good place to dig. The young or small yellow yams are called 'ngabilyi'. The large round yams under the main stem are called 'damangka' which also means 'head'; yams are called this because this yam can get very big, like a person's head.

It can be used for wrapping food before cooking in ashes or in a ground oven. Large sheets of this bark can be used to make wet season shelters to keep the rain off, or dry season shelters to keep the sun off. The bark is good to put inside wooden coolamons called 'kawarla' to create a soft padding for a baby to lie on. The bark can be used to make a pouch to carry stone knives and stone spearheads so they remain sharp and do not get damaged.

It is a ground dweller and digs little holes looking for food. During the day it hides in grassy areas where it makes a small camp in thick grass. Sometimes it also hides in hollow logs on the ground. At night, it moves around and hunts for food. Bandicoots sometimes hop around like little wallabies and can also run like big rats. Bandicoots have not been seen in recent times. In the past, they would be common at times and then would not be seen at other times. Following good wet seasons and lots of rain, they would be seen in large numbers, especially near rivers and waterholes. There used to be quite a few at Beetaloo.

\ee The fruit are eaten when they are ripe - green with a slightly orange-yellow colour. They are sweet and very tasty. The unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help them ripen. Sometimes this might take as long as two weeks. When the fruit are fully ripe they are called 'mawukala'. They have a very strong, pleasant smell, which can be noticed a long way from the plant. The wood is used as firewood as it lights quickly and easily. Red-tailed black-cockatoos called 'lirralirraka' also like to eat the seed of the fruit. The inner bark or cleaned roots can also be used as medicine. It is chipped into small pieces and boiled in water until the water becomes red. This liquid is used as a wash applied frequently to treat boils called '(w)ukurliji'; and skin sores, chicken pox, or scabies called 'jangawurru'. If the liquid is boiled more, it turns into a liniment that can be used for pains in the chest, muscles and joints. You must not get this medicine near your eyes. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season are coming, this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is waved towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

They are cooked in the same way as the black-headed python, and can have a lot of meat on them, as they can get very large. Their meat tastes similar to goanna flesh. This snake has important Dreamings around Juna (Beetaloo waterhole). Along with Kiwarlija, he created the central Dreaming track for Jingulu people. All the other Dreaming tracks connect with or cross this one. There are songs associated with this snake.

\ee This large tree is common on Mudburra country. It is an excellent shade tree. Many birds sit in this tree and like to eat the red flowers. The inner red bark of the trunk or the roots can be used to make a strong medicine. They are boiled in water and the liquid is used as a wash, and a little is drunk, to treat headaches; scabies, skin ulcers, skin sores called 'jangawurru'; and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. This medicine is used a few times a day for a few days and will cure most skin problems. The leaves can also be chewed to treat congestion. They can also be chewed when you are thirsty and in need of water. This helps to produce saliva and stops the feeling of intense thirst. The gum is called 'kuramarna' which refers to the edible gum from any tree. The fruit or pods are called 'ngabilibili'. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in the trunk of this tree, and also in the roots sometimes. The red flowers can be sucked to get the sweet nectar. They can also be collected in a tin and mixed with water to make a sweet drink. The outer bark is burnt to a fine white ash called 'buna', which is then added to chewing tobacco called 'warnu'. The twigs can be made into paint brushes or spoons called 'junji' used for painting or for extracting honey.

\ee Mosquitoes are often active at dawn and dusk; they bite and suck your blood. They are most common after heavy rains and during the wet season. Mosquitoes can be chased away by lighting a smoky fire or by placing dry manure from horses or cattle on the coals. The smoke from burning gutta-percha leaves and wood, or from 'kirnima', the wax from spinifex, is especially good for repelling mosquitos.

\ee After a young man is initiated, he and his 'full' (i.e., biological) sisters can no longer say each other's names out loud. Instead, they might say 'so-and-so', use each other's initials, or use a nickname like 'bro' or 'sis'. Additionally, for the first few years after the initiation, the young man's sisters and female cousins can refer to him as 'yirrimaka'. Some people also follow these same restrictions with their classificatory siblings - that is, with everyone who is of the right skin group regardless of any biological relationship.

\ee When the hard, dark fruits of the nutwood are ripe, they can be broken open to reveal the edible seed inside. Camels also like to eat the entire fruit. The timber makes good firewood called 'warlu' and it is common to find sugarbag called 'ngarlu' in the trunk. The outer bark produces fine black soot when it is burnt. This can be used as colour during ceremonies. In the past, it was rubbed onto the skin of light-skinned babies to stop sunburn. This tree casts good shade, and kangaroos often sit under them.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'burning' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. To 'burn' a baby, light a fire and heat up some pieces of antbed. When the fire has burned down to coals, the antbed pieces will be glowing red. Scoop some out to one side, then put some water on the fire and cover it with leafy twigs such as 'mulurrmi' (turpentine wattle) or 'bikirra' (grass type), and then put the reserved chunks of antbed on top. When the plants heat up and begin to smoke, hold the baby over them so that the smoke goes all over the baby and its mother. The pieces of antbed are crushed during the smoking to reveal still-red parts. Cooled charred pieces of antbed are used to treat sick people (especially infants). They are crushed in water to make a thick black slurry. The slurry is rubbed on a child from head to toe. The black water may also be sipped. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called 'wanbuni'. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee In classical Mudburra society, deaths were almost always considered to be murders, regardless of their apparent cause. This meant that after every death, a ‘barnkarranga’ would need to be found. This was done with a ‘warlamarra’ (divination fire used to reveal the murderer). When a person died, their body would be placed on a platform up in a tree. Once the body swelled and began to ooze, a ‘warlamarra’ would be lit under the tree. As the body heated and burned, its fat would drip into the fire and stoke it, causing smoke to rise. The smoke would drift away and find the murderer, even if they were very far away. When the smoke from the ‘warlamarra’ reached the murderer, they would start to go insane and cry out, “Wardayi! (Oh no, poor me!)”. They would also start to get sick: their fingers and toes would shrivel, and their whole arm might even fall off. The path of the smoke, combined with this onset of these symptoms, would reveal to everyone else that they were the murderer. Alternately, sometimes people would find out the murderer’s identity by cracking the skull of the deceased with an axeblade before putting the body up into the tree. This would also cause the murderer to go insane.

\ee Quolls used to be seen around, generally in the northern areas, but have not been seen on Jingulu or Mudburra country since Pompey Raymond was quite young, probably in the 1940s and 1950s. In the past they were eaten, but they did not have much meat. The males had a bad smell. They always lived by themselves and the mother would look after the babies. The quoll has white spots on its back and lives in grassy areas and in hollow logs, particularly in lancewood and bulwaddy country. Eagle-hawks used to hunt them sometimes. Quolls were good at hunting small birds and grasshoppers. They could have three or four, or even up to 10, babies at a time.

\ee Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in this tree. The timber makes good firewood called 'warlu' for cooking. Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollowed branches of a suitable size. The bark can also be burnt to a fine white ash called 'buna' to mix with chewing tobacco called 'warnu'. The leafy branches and bark can be used to make a bough shelter. The leaves can be boiled in water, and the cooled liquid used as a wash to treat internal pain; aching joints; itchy skin; skin sores and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. You can also sip a little bit if you are congested or have a headache. The leaves can also be chewed to keep your mouth moist while walking.

\ee Stress on second syllable. The stems of young straight trees are used as spear shafts for hunting fish called 'kakuwi' or 'yawu' and wallabies. The timber can also be used to make the hook of a spear-thrower. The leaves and the green pods can be rubbed with a little water to make a soapy lather used for washing. The seeds can be eaten when ripe or ground into flour on grinding stones. This flour can then be wrapped in paperbark or water-lily leaves and cooked in hot coals to make small dampers or johnny cakes. Branches can be thrown into small waterholes, which will kill the fish in a day or two. The fish can then be caught, cooked and eaten.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'burning' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. To 'burn' a baby, light a fire and heat up some pieces of antbed. When the fire has burned down to coals, the antbed pieces will be glowing red. Scoop some out to one side, then put some water on the fire and cover it with leafy twigs such as 'mulurrmi' (turpentine wattle) or 'bikirra' (grass type), and then put the reserved chunks of antbed on top. When the plants heat up and begin to smoke, hold the baby over them so that the smoke goes all over the baby and its mother. The pieces of antbed are crushed during the smoking to reveal still-red parts. Cooled charred pieces of antbed are used to treat sick people (especially infants). They are crushed in water to make a thick black slurry. The slurry is rubbed on a child from head to toe. The black water may also be sipped. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called 'wanbuni'. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee This large gum tree grows by rivers and creeks called 'binka'. There are a lot of large old trees at Lake Woods. The outer bark can be chopped off and used as a coolamon called 'kawarla'. The timber can also be carved into a canoe-shaped coolamon. It also makes good firewood called 'warlu'. Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollow branches. This tree provides very good medicine. The new leaves are crushed and then boiled in water, and this liquid is used as a wash to treat coughs and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya', and skin problems. A small amount may also be drunk to treat coughing. The liquid has a good smell, like Vicks, a commercial ointment with a strong smell. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in this tree. Witchetty grubs called 'laju' can also be found in the lower part of its trunk. Birds and possums make nests in the large old hollow trees. The leaves can be added to meat when cooking it in the ground. It keeps the meat moist and gives it a nice 'salty' flavour.

Flying-foxes are no longer eaten, though, due to fear of lyssa-virus, a disease carried by flying-foxes that can be transferred to people. This flying-fox generally occurs in 'drier country' to the south, but there was also a colony in Elliott in 2016 and 2017. They like to eat the fruit of the introduced neem tree.

\ee The hard wood of this tree is especially good for making boomerangs called 'kurrubardu'. The wood is dark like gutta-percha ('manyingila'), but harder.
\ee The fruit and bark are scraped and the scrapings are mixed with water to make a medicine that is applied to small children. It makes them strong and helps them start walking. The fruit are also boiled in water, and babies are made to sit in the liquid once it has cooled down. This practice also strengthens their legs and hips to help them start walking. The leaves and wood may be burnt to ash and mixed with water and this is used to treat broken bones, sore joints and bruising in adults.
\ee The corky bark of this tree is used as medicine for sores on the lips and in the mouth. It is burnt down to ash and then ground into a fine powder. This powder is then rubbed onto 'cold sores' and any other sores on the lips or in the mouth. You can also dip your finger in fat and then in the powder and then rub this mixture on the sores. This medicine works well for children and infants.

\ee This is a Kriol word. In the past people used to eat cat meat after roasting it in a ground oven. It has a strong smell and a good taste, like possum meat. It was eaten up until recent times and it is still a favoured meat for many elders. The Mudburra name 'nyurnam' refers to the round shape of their faces. Sometimes you can tease people by calling them 'nyurnambari', meaning 'pussy cat face'. The Jingulu name kardayi refers to the way they look at you. Feral cats are good hunters and eat a lot of small native animals. The males, tom cats, can get very large and aggressive.

\ee The fruit are eaten when they are ripe - green with a slightly orange-yellow colour. They are sweet and very tasty. The unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help them ripen. Sometimes this might take as long as two weeks. When the fruit are fully ripe they are called 'mawukala'. They have a very strong, pleasant smell, which can be noticed a long way from the plant. The wood is used as firewood as it lights quickly and easily. Red-tailed black-cockatoos called 'lirralirraka' also like to eat the seed of the fruit. The inner bark or cleaned roots can also be used as medicine. It is chipped into small pieces and boiled in water until the water becomes red. This liquid is used as a wash applied frequently to treat boils called '(w)ukurliji'; and skin sores, chicken pox, or scabies called 'jangawurru'. If the liquid is boiled more, it turns into a liniment that can be used for pains in the chest, muscles and joints. You must not get this medicine near your eyes. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season are coming, this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is waved towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

\ee These large flies can give a painful sting, particularly often around the lower leg and ankles. They are slow-moving and easy to kill. There is a bird called 'bujurrdayidayi' that calls out when march-flies time has arrived. It is called 'burrjurndayidayi' because this is the sound of the call it makes. The march-fly is also associated with the 'kiyirnmini' (yellow tree snake). This snake likes breast milk. It will go and suck milk from a young woman who is breast feeding so young mothers are warned not to go near the river. The snake knows that there are people by the river because the march-fly gives them away.

The meat inside the shell is eaten after lightly cooking on hot coals or in a small grass fire. As it burns, it lightly cooks the meat. The shells open up when the meat is cooked. The meat is really good tasting and nice to eat, like eating at a restaurant. The meat is also used to treat congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The hard shell can be used as a spoon, and the sharpened edge was used as a knife in the past. Shards of broken mussel shell are sharp and can cut your foot if you walk on them.

\ee This tree grows in northern areas of Jingulu and Mudburra country; there are lots around Larrimah. The swollen tap root of young plants can be dug up, roasted and then eaten. It is a long thin yam which is good to eat. The bark of young plants can be made into string. This string is very long-lasting and strong. It can be used to tie spearheads onto spear shafts or hooks onto spear-throwers, or to tie up bundles of food, firewood or any other items. In the past it was used to make nagas or loincloths for women, and was used to make special headbands worn by men during ceremonies. Paint brushes can be made from twigs and from small saplings. The ends are crushed with a stone to make the brush part. The gum can be used as medicine. It is applied directly to sores and cuts. The inner bark is also used as a bandage, as it has an open weave pattern like a bandage. It is good for treating cuts and wounds from being hit with boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and fighting sticks called 'kuduru'.

\ee These trees are generally referred to as 'gum trees'. Their timber makes good firewood called 'warlu' as it burns slowly and evenly. The outer smooth white bark is burnt to a fine white ash called 'buna' to mix with chewing tobacco called 'warnu'. The bark is either collected dry and burnt straight away, or chopped wet from the tree and left to dry out for a few days before burning. The outer bark is also used to make special boomerangs that are used during ceremonies. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in this tree. Sugar-leaf (lerps) called 'nanjarrnga' can be found on the leaves. As with the Hill Bloodwood and the Bloodwood, the red sap of this tree is called 'diyinu' and makes good medicine. It can be placed directly onto an aching tooth to stop the pain. It can also be boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat skin sores.

\ee This large gum tree grows by rivers and creeks called 'binka'. There are a lot of large old trees at Lake Woods. The outer bark can be chopped off and used as a coolamon called 'kawarla'. The timber can also be carved into a canoe-shaped coolamon. It also makes good firewood called 'warlu'. Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollow branches. This tree provides very good medicine. The new leaves are crushed and then boiled in water, and this liquid is used as a wash to treat coughs and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya', and skin problems. A small amount may also be drunk to treat coughing. The liquid has a good smell, like Vicks, a commercial ointment with a strong smell. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in this tree. Witchetty grubs called 'laju' can also be found in the lower part of its trunk. Birds and possums make nests in the large old hollow trees. The leaves can be added to meat when cooking it in the ground. It keeps the meat moist and gives it a nice 'salty' flavour.

It lays its eggs on the ground and, if you walk near the nest, it will swoop and chase you, trying to poke you with the little nail in its wing. Pregnant ladies must copy the plover at night. Plovers call out at night with a loud, distinctive call.

\ee This is the biggest hunting bird. They can catch small kangaroos and wallabies and also hunt for bush turkeys called 'kurrkabadi'. They are often seen high in the sky, slowly circling and looking for food. They also like to eat roadkill. They often get hit by cars because they are slow to take off. There is an important Dreamtime story about this bird which is connected to men's business. It has the skin names Jalyirri or Nalyirri and Jimija or Namija.

\ee In the big wet seasons, mussels can be found in large numbers in waterholes and lakes; you can just collect them from the mud at the bottom. The meat inside the shell is eaten after lightly cooking on hot coals or in a small grass fire. As it burns, it lightly cooks the meat. The shells open up when the meat is cooked. The meat is really good tasting and nice to eat, like eating at a restaurant. The meat is also used to treat congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The hard shell can be used as a spoon, and the sharpened edge was used as a knife in the past. Shards of broken mussel shell are sharp and can cut your foot if you walk on them.

They were collected from antbeds (termite mounds) and then winnowed in coolamons called 'kawarla' to remove dust and grass seeds.

The younger, greener stems can be boiled in water the liquid washed through the hair to make the hair grow longer. The small, clear fruit can be eaten when they are ripe, but they are bit spicy and you have to be careful or they will hurt your mouth.

\ee Possum meat can be eaten after roasting in a ground oven with paperbark; it is very tasty meat and quite tender. Sometimes possums sleep in the forks of trees, but more often, they prefer to live in hollow parts of large trees. They often live together in groups; sometimes there are several, maybe four, inside one large hollow tree. You can see their climbing tracks on the trunks of trees that they live in. When you find a tree they are in, you throw a stone down the hole, and they will run out. When you catch a possum, you have to be careful, as they have sharp claws and can scratch you. They like hollow snappy gums, bloodwoods, coolabahs and river red gums. They sleep all day in these hollow trees and hunt around for food in the night. They don't like the sunshine. They really like to eat sugar-leaf (lerps) called 'wandala' or 'nanjarrnga'; and sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu'. They also eat flowers and ripe fruit. There were lots at Longreach, Beetaloo Station and Murranji in the past, but now there are very few. There are still some at Daly Waters, but in recent times none have been seen around Elliott.

\ee Eel-tail catfish are good to eat, with soft, tender flesh and very few bones. They are cooked by roasting on hot coals and ashes. They can get quite big, up to 25 cm long. They have nails or prickles in their fins, and, if these poke you, the wound will swell and be very painful for a long time. You can ease the pain by poking that same area with the same prickle again. In the mid to late wet season when the floodwaters are starting to form, there are often schools of baby nailfish called 'ninyida' in the grassy water edges. These can be collected in large numbers and all cooked together and then eaten. They taste good and are too small to have dangerous spines.

\ee These insects hold their front legs up like they are praying. They also sometimes look like sticks in colour and shape. If one flies into your head it will cause a headache. You can stop the headache, though, by catching the insect and gently running it around in circles on the top of your head several times, then carefully letting it go. The term 'wajirrki' was also used to refer to helicopters and a very bad flu that could kill you in station days.

\ee The meat in the body and tail of this animal is very good to eat after roasting on hot coals. The shell and head are peeled off and the white meat is eaten. The meat is also good bait for catching fish called 'kakuwi' with a hand-line. These animals are commonly found at Longreach Waterhole. In the past they were caught by hand, but people use nets and traps as well now. Mudburra elders from Marlinja consider them to be recent arrivals that were not on Mudburra country in the past, and that have only arrived since white people came.

The meat of this lizard are eaten after roasting on hot coals and ashes. You can also burn its frill on a fire and then rub it through your hair to make your hair grow long and stay black. This lizard is the brother of 'kidkilyi' (ring-tailed dragon). They both have the skin name Jangala. They had a fight in the Dreamtime. Jamankula put his frill down and convinced Kidkilyi that he had cut his hair, and that Kidkilyi should cut his hair too.

\ee This kangaroo has a 'milinji' (nail) in the end of its tail. It often makes an 'oo...oo...oo' or 'ngung...ngung' noise while hopping. The name 'ngungungmarna' refers to this sound. It holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. Some of its language names refer to its left-handedness. These kangaroos sometimes have a distinctive humped back. They are only seen by themselves, not in groups. They often live in lancewood and bulwaddy country. The flesh can be eaten after roasting in a ground oven, but it does not taste very good and is rarely eaten. It is good to make soup from it.

\ee Bush turkey meat is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. It is very tasty and is considered the best bush meat by many people. In the past, only people who had been through ceremony could eat bush turkey meat, but now everyone eats it. Bush turkeys are found in open plains and grassy country, and they are often specifically hunted. In the past they were hunted with boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and spears, but now they are hunted with shotguns and rifles. When you get close to a bush turkey and are ready to kill it, you can whistle. This makes them stop still and look around, allowing you to kill them easily. Bush turkeys like to eat grasshoppers called 'waniyi', and conkerberry fruit called 'baka' or 'ngamanburru'. Bush turkeys are often seen in pairs, looking around for food to eat. As they walk around they often look upwards to see if wedge-tailed eagles are hunting for them. They hide in the grass if they see you hunting them. Their small fluffy feathers can be used as body decoration for ceremonies. The throat pouch of males is called 'larraranga'. They use this pouch to make a rumbling sound when they are looking a wife. They have the skin names Jangala or Nangala and Jambijina or Nambijina.

\ee Possum meat can be eaten after roasting in a ground oven with paperbark; it is very tasty meat and quite tender. Sometimes possums sleep in the forks of trees, but more often, they prefer to live in hollow parts of large trees. They often live together in groups; sometimes there are several, maybe four, inside one large hollow tree. You can see their climbing tracks on the trunks of trees that they live in. When you find a tree they are in, you throw a stone down the hole, and they will run out. When you catch a possum, you have to be careful, as they have sharp claws and can scratch you. They like hollow snappy gums, bloodwoods, coolabahs and river red gums. They sleep all day in these hollow trees and hunt around for food in the night. They don't like the sunshine. They really like to eat sugar-leaf (lerps) called 'wandala' or 'nanjarrnga'; and sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu'. They also eat flowers and ripe fruit. There were lots at Longreach, Beetaloo Station and Murranji in the past, but now there are very few. There are still some at Daly Waters, but in recent times none have been seen around Elliott.

\ee The timber makes good firewood called 'warlu'. Sugarbag (native bee-hive) called 'ngarlu' is often found in this tree. Sugarbag contains honey, pollen and wax. Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollow branches. As with the Hill Bloodwood and the Ghost (White) Gum, the red sap of this tree is called 'diyinu' and is good medicine. It can be placed directly onto an aching tooth to stop the pain. It can also be boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat skin sores. The knobs on the trunks can be cut off, and sometimes they contain water that can be drunk. People often looked for these while on long walks with little water.

The stems can be softened on a fire, pounded and then buried in wet sand for a few minutes. This produces a bandage which feels cool and sticky, and is soft enough to wrap around the head, back, swollen joints, feet or limbs to relieve pain.

\ee These yams are round and can grow up to about 20 cm in diameter. They are often covered in hairy roots and have small yams growing off the side. This yam can be dug up and eaten, but it must be carefully prepared first or it will burn your mouth badly. In traditional times, the old men used to prepare the yams by crushing them with a stone and then mixing them with fat, or by chopping them into small pieces and soaking the pieces in water for a long time. This cheeky yam is rare on Mudburra country and only occurs in northern areas near Daly Waters and Larrimah.

Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollow branches. As with the Hill Bloodwood and the Ghost (White) Gum, the red sap of this tree is called 'diyinu' and is good medicine. It can be placed directly onto an aching tooth to stop the pain. It can also be boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat skin sores. The knobs on the trunks can be cut off, and sometimes they contain water that can be drunk. People often looked for these while on long walks with little water.

\ee This plant has pretty pink flowers and grows in red plains country. The yams are dug up and eaten; they have an excellent taste and can often be collected in large numbers. The yams can be eaten lightly roasted or boiled. The root system of this plant is expansive and the yams are usually found quite far from the plant. People locate them by looking for cracks in the ground: the roots and bulbs often crack the ground above them. These cracks can be followed to find large yams below. The yams can also be found by tapping the ground around the plant with a digging stick. If a hollow noise is heard, it indicates a large yam is below and it is a good place to dig. The young or small yellow yams are called 'ngabilyi'. The large round yams under the main stem are called 'damangka' which also means 'head'; yams are called this because this yam can get very big, like a person's head.

If you see one of these birds, you know that the old people are close. Because the spirits of ancestors and 'ngurramala' (traditional owners) are in these birds, they also keep an eye on country. They will scold someone if they are from another country and have entered the area or have gone for a swim without being introduced to country properly. You can introduce a stranger to country by dousing their head or rubbing them with mud. These birds also bring luck to card games. They have the skin name Jangala or Nangala.

If you see one of these birds, you know that the old people are close. Because the spirits of ancestors and 'ngurramala' (traditional owners) are in these birds, they also keep an eye on country. They will scold someone if they are from another country and have entered the area or have gone for a swim without being introduced to country properly. You can introduce a stranger to country by dousing their head or rubbing them with mud. These birds also bring luck to card games. They have the skin name Jangala or Nangala.

\ee This large tree is common on Mudburra country. It is an excellent shade tree. Many birds sit in this tree and like to eat the red flowers. The inner red bark of the trunk or the roots can be used to make a strong medicine. They are boiled in water and the liquid is used as a wash, and a little is drunk, to treat headaches; scabies, skin ulcers, skin sores called 'jangawurru'; and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. This medicine is used a few times a day for a few days and will cure most skin problems. The leaves can also be chewed to treat congestion. They can also be chewed when you are thirsty and in need of water. This helps to produce saliva and stops the feeling of intense thirst. The gum is called 'kuramarna' which refers to the edible gum from any tree. The fruit or pods are called 'ngabilibili'. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in the trunk of this tree, and also in the roots sometimes. The red flowers can be sucked to get the sweet nectar. They can also be collected in a tin and mixed with water to make a sweet drink. The outer bark is burnt to a fine white ash called 'buna', which is then added to chewing tobacco called 'warnu'. The twigs can be made into paint brushes or spoons called 'junji' used for painting or for extracting honey.

\ee Quolls used to be seen around, generally in the northern areas, but have not been seen on Jingulu or Mudburra country since Pompey Raymond was quite young, probably in the 1940s and 1950s. In the past they were eaten, but they did not have much meat. The males had a bad smell. They always lived by themselves and the mother would look after the babies. The quoll has white spots on its back and lives in grassy areas and in hollow logs, particularly in lancewood and bulwaddy country. Eagle-hawks used to hunt them sometimes. Quolls were good at hunting small birds and grasshoppers. They could have three or four, or even up to 10, babies at a time.

\ee The small bulbs of the bush onion can be eaten and are very tasty. In the past they were an important food resource. They grow underground but close to the surface, and so are easy to dig out and can often be collected in large numbers. They are lightly cooked in hot sand and then rubbed between the palms to loosen the dark brown, papery skin. The skin is then blown away from the little yams. Brolgas called 'kurrarndala' like to eat the small bulbs too. This bulbs grow well in northern areas, such as Nutwood Downs and Daly Waters, but also grows in other parts of Mudburra country. There are some growing in the sandy soils near North Camp in Elliott.

\ee This kangaroo has a 'milnji' (nail) in the end of its tail. It often makes an 'oo...oo...oo' or 'ngung...ngung' noise while hopping. The name 'ngungungmarna' refers to this sound. It holds its left arm up to its chest when hopping, and is sometimes called 'Left-hand Charlie' because of this habit. Some of its language names refer to its left-handedness. These kangaroos sometimes have a distinctive humped back. They are only seen by themselves, not in groups. They often live in lancewood and bulwaddy country. The flesh can be eaten after roasting in a ground oven, but it does not taste very good and is rarely eaten. It is good to make soup from it.

\ee The northern blue-tongue is considered to be male and is generally bigger than the desert blue-tongue. The skin on its back is dark brown to black, and unlike the desert blue-tongue, it does not have a black mask on its face. The meat from this lizard is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. The skin needs to be scraped off before eating as it is quite scaly and sticks to the meat. Northern blue-tongues are easy to catch because they cannot run very fast. You can easily knock them on the head with a stick. They can bite hard, though, so you need to be careful with them. They are fattest in the hot weather season, so this is the best time to eat them.

This is possibly an extinct species of taipan (Oxyuranus), one of the world's most venomous snakes, or an extant species whose geographic range has reduced within the last few thousand years. It could be the western taipan, or fierce snake, Oxyuranus microlepidotus. This snake currently occurs in western Queensland but not in the NT.

The pups were most tender and were good to eat. The meat tasted similar to meat from a cat. They have not been eaten for a long time. People in the old days used to keep dingoes as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and lizards. They were very good at finding game and were sometimes called 'goanna dogs'. They were not good pets, though, because they would kill animals at stations such as chickens and goats.

\ee These lizards can be aggressive; the big ones will chase you if you go near them. When you try to catch them they often hide behind a tree or antbed. They like to eat ants, termites, grasshoppers and the flying ants that come out after rain. You often see them near antbeds looking for a feed. The meat of this lizard is eaten after roasting on hot coals and ashes. You can also burn its frill on a fire and then rub it through your hair to make your hair grow long and stay black. This lizard is the brother of 'kidkilyi' (ring-tailed dragon). They both have the skin name Jangala. They had a fight in the Dreamtime. Kidkilyi went to live in the plains country and Jamankula went to the red soil country around Daly Waters.

\ee This is the largest kangaroo and the adult males can be very tall and muscular. The meat is eaten after roasting and is very tasty. Some people think this is the best kangaroo meat. They are most commonly seen in the southern areas, but they live everywhere. They are common in the Elliott area and other places like Marlinja and Beetaloo. This kangaroo is sometimes also called 'kajangarna' (or 'kajangarnarra'). This name means bush-dweller and refers to their preferred habitat in bush areas.

\ee The stems of young straight trees are used as spear shafts for hunting fish called 'kakuwi' or 'yawu' and wallabies. The timber can also be used to make the hook of a spear-thrower. The leaves and the green pods can be rubbed with a little water to make a soapy lather used for washing. The seeds can be eaten when ripe or ground into flour on grinding stones. This flour can then be wrapped in paperbark or water-lily leaves and cooked in hot coals to make small dampers or johnny cakes. Branches can be thrown into small waterholes, which will kill the fish in a day or two. The fish can then be caught, cooked and eaten.

They may be dug up easily as they do not grow very deep and the black soil is easy to dig. They are best dug up soon after the wet season finishes when the soil is still soft. They are eaten after a short roasting in hot coals. The first year tubers are very tasty; they are small, sweet and tender like baby carrots. They are attached to the trailing branches of the vine.

They are then collected and peeled to get the seeds out. The seeds can be eaten raw; they are oily but very tasty. They can also be sun-dried and then ground into flour for dampers or johnny cakes, which are lightly roasted and then eaten. The tuber or yam at the base of the water-lily is also edible. It is buried in the mud of the bottom of the billabong. It can be dug out by hand, then roasted on hot coals, peeled and eaten. It tastes good, like butter.

\ee Mosquitoes are often active at dawn and dusk; they bite and suck your blood. They are most common after heavy rains and during the wet season. Mosquitoes can be chased away by lighting a smoky fire or by placing dry manure from horses or cattle on the coals. The smoke from burning gutta-percha leaves and wood, or from 'kirnima', the wax from spinifex, is especially good for repelling mosquitos.

Additionally, for the first few years after the initiation, the young man's sisters and female cousins can refer to him as 'yirrimaka'.

\ee The wood of this tree is hard, strong and dark in colour. It makes excellent firewood as it burns evenly for long periods. The smoke from the burning wood repels mosquitoes called 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. The trunks and roots often contain witchetty grubs called 'laju', which are good to eat. The stems can be used for bough shelters, fence rails and fence posts. The wood is also used for boomerangs called 'kurrubardu'; clapsticks called 'karnbaj' or 'kurndarnnga'; spearheads; shields called 'kuwarri'; and fighting sticks called 'kuduru'. The outer bark is called 'manjarna' or 'kurrunyu'. It can be pulled off the trunks and used to make bough shelters or humpies. The dried bark is also good for lighting fires. The inner part of the fluted trunk bark can be chewed and sucked. It is not much food, but it's good for keeping your mouth moist. The inner bark can also be used as a spoon or brush called a 'junji' to extract honey from sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu'. The string or rope made from this inner bark is called 'yubungu'.

\ee Mudburra society is divided into eight subsections, also called skin groups. Every person is born into one (or sometimes two) of these groups, with membership determined by which groups their parents are in. A person's skin group membership influences many aspects of their life, including who they can marry. Appropriate ('straight') marriage partnerships are as follows: Janama-Nawurla, Jurla-Nanaku, Jabarda-Nalyirri, Jalyirri-Nimarra, Jimija-Nangala, Jangala-Namija, Jambijina-Nangari, Jangari-Nambijina. In the past, 'wrong-way' marriages (partnerships that did not comply with these skin group pairings) were sometimes punished harshly.

In traditional times, the old men used to prepare the yams by crushing them with a stone and then mixing them with fat, or by chopping them into small pieces and soaking the pieces in water for a long time.

\ee The fruit of this plant is light green in colour with a strong, sweet, fruity smell when fully ripe. The fruit may be eaten at this time; it has a sweet taste and crispy texture. It is very good food, tasting similar to the commercial cucumber you can buy in shops. The fruit must be rubbed before eating, however, to remove any short hairs from the outside. If these are not removed, they can hurt your lips and tongue. If you eat too much of this fruit, you will get a sore mouth, sore throat and a headache. This plant is recognised as being similar to the bitter cucumber, above, but it has different qualities and the fruit are smaller and sweet tasting.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'burning' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. To 'burn' a baby, light a fire and heat up some pieces of antbed. When the fire has burned down to coals, the antbed pieces will be glowing red. Scoop some out to one side, then put some water on the fire and cover it with leafy twigs such as 'mulurrmi' (turpentine wattle) or 'bikirra' (grass type), and then put the reserved chunks of antbed on top. When the plants heat up and begin to smoke, hold the baby over them so that the smoke goes all over the baby and its mother. The pieces of antbed are crushed during the smoking to reveal still-red parts. Cooled charred pieces of antbed are used to treat sick people (especially infants). They are crushed in water to make a thick black slurry. The slurry is rubbed on a child from head to toe. The black water may also be sipped. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called 'wanbuni'. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee The small bulbs of the bush onion can be eaten and are very tasty. In the past they were an important food resource. They grow underground but close to the surface, and so are easy to dig out and can often be collected in large numbers. They are lightly cooked in hot sand and then rubbed between the palms to loosen the dark brown, papery skin. The skin is then blown away from the little yams. Brolgas called 'kurrarndala' like to eat the small bulbs too. This bulbs grow well in northern areas, such as Nutwood Downs and Daly Waters, but also grows in other parts of Mudburra country. There are some growing in the sandy soils near North Camp in Elliott.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'burning' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. To 'burn' a baby, light a fire and heat up some pieces of antbed. When the fire has burned down to coals, the antbed pieces will be glowing red. Scoop some out to one side, then put some water on the fire and cover it with leafy twigs such as 'mulurrmi' (turpentine wattle) or 'bikirra' (grass type), and then put the reserved chunks of antbed on top. When the plants heat up and begin to smoke, hold the baby over them so that the smoke goes all over the baby and its mother. The pieces of antbed are crushed during the smoking to reveal still-red parts. Cooled charred pieces of antbed are used to treat sick people (especially infants). They are crushed in water to make a thick black slurry. The slurry is rubbed on a child from head to toe. The black water may also be sipped. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called 'wanbuni'. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee Eel-tail Catfish are good to eat, with soft, tender flesh and very few bones. They are cooked by roasting on hot coals and ashes. They can get quite big, up to 25 cm long. They have nails or prickles in their fins, and, if these poke you, the wound will swell and be very painful for a long time. You can ease the pain by poking that same area with the same prickle again. In the mid to late wet season when the floodwaters are starting to form, there are often schools of baby nailfish called 'ngirnngirda' in the grassy water edges. These can be collected in large numbers and all cooked together and then eaten. They taste good and are too small to have dangerous spines.

When this grass is burnt during the early dry season, it cleans up the country and makes it healthy again. Burning this grass is a good way to hunt out kangaroos.

\ee The sweet, tasty black fruit are eaten when they are ripe. They were an important food resource in the past and were collected in large bags. The fruit and seed inside can also be pounded on a flat rock and made into small dampers, which are lightly roasted and highly regarded as a food source. The tree generally fruits around the early wet season, but sometimes the fruit are also available later in the year. When the firefly begins blinking its light, it indicates the fruit are ripe and ready to eat. This plant only occurs in northern areas of Jingulu and Mudburra country, in places such as Hayfield, Nutwood Downs, Danumbirini and Daly Waters.

\ee These small mouse-like animals live on plains country and around waterholes. They prefer black soil plains, which is their home. After a big wet season, they are often seen in large numbers. They live in burrows and cracks in the clay soil, sometimes with many in one burrow. You can poke a stick down and sometimes lots will run out. They do not hop like other native mice; they run instead. These creatures walk around looking for food all the time and sometimes travel in large migrating groups. They hunt for food at night and eat almost anything small. They especially like to eat centipedes, small lizards and grasshoppers, but they also eat finches. When they hunt finches they jump at them like a cat. In the past they were eaten, even though they're very small, because they sometimes occurred in vast enough numbers that lots could be caught. Eagle-hawks and snakes like to eat them as well. So do feral cats and dogs. Lady Dixon said that old people used to sing special songs when they found their little tracks to make them breed.

They are very tasty and much sought after. If the pods are dry they can be collected and placed on a calico mat, then hit with a stick to release the seeds. The seeds are collected and ground up into a coarse powder that can then be eaten.

\ee This large gum tree grows by rivers and creeks called 'binka'. There are a lot of large old trees at Lake Woods. The outer bark can be chopped off and used as a coolamon called 'kawarla'. The timber can also be carved into a canoe-shaped coolamon. It also makes good firewood called 'warlu'. Didgeridoos called 'kulumbu' can be made from hollow branches. This tree provides very good medicine. The new leaves are crushed and then boiled in water, and this liquid is used as a wash to treat coughs and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya', and skin problems. A small amount may also be drunk to treat coughing. The liquid has a good smell, like Vicks, a commercial ointment with a strong smell. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in this tree. Witchetty grubs called 'laju' can also be found in the lower part of its trunk. Birds and possums make nests in the large old hollow trees. The leaves can be added to meat when cooking it in the ground. It keeps the meat moist and gives it a nice 'salty' flavour.

\ee In the old days, these fire-drills, or firesticks, were carried everywhere and could be used many times. In the wet season they were wrapped in paperbark to keep them dry. To make firesticks, a straight, smooth, narrow stem is cut to about 40 cm long. A broader, heavier stem is also cut, and a small, round hole with a vee is carved into it. One end of the narrow stick is placed in the hole of the heavier stick, and a clump of fine, dry grass is piled up underneath. The narrow stick is then rotated quickly between the palms with a strong downward pressure. This drilling creates friction which in turn creates a very hot, fine dust. This dust pours down the vee carved into the heavier piece of wood and onto the dry grass below. The grass and the very hot dust are gently blown on until flame appears.

They are then rinsed and eaten like wild rice. You can also find witchetty grubs called 'laju' in the roots. The hard wood of straight stems can be used to make spear shafts.

\ee In the big wet seasons, mussels can be found in large numbers in waterholes and lakes; you can just collect them from the mud at the bottom. The meat inside the shell is eaten after lightly cooking on hot coals or in a small grass fire. As it burns, it lightly cooks the meat. The shells open up when the meat is cooked. The meat is really good tasting and nice to eat, like eating at a restaurant. The meat is also used to treat congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The hard shell can be used as a spoon, and the sharpened edge was used as a knife in the past. Shards of broken mussel shell are sharp and can cut your foot if you walk on them.

\ee The fruit are eaten when they are ripe - green with a slightly orange-yellow colour. They are sweet and very tasty. The unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help them ripen. Sometimes this might take as long as two weeks. When the fruit are fully ripe they are called 'mawukala'. They have a very strong, pleasant smell, which can be noticed a long way from the plant. The wood is used as firewood as it lights quickly and easily. Red-tailed black-cockatoos called 'lirralirraka' also like to eat the seed of the fruit. The inner bark or cleaned roots can also be used as medicine. It is chipped into small pieces and boiled in water until the water becomes red. This liquid is used as a wash applied frequently to treat boils called '(w)ukurliji'; and skin sores, chicken pox, or scabies called 'jangawurru'. If the liquid is boiled more, it turns into a liniment that can be used for pains in the chest, muscles and joints. You must not get this medicine near your eyes. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season are coming, this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is waved towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

\ee Bush turkey meat is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. It is very tasty and is considered the best bush meat by many people. In the past, only people who had been through ceremony could eat bush turkey meat, but now everyone eats it. Bush turkeys are found in open plains and grassy country, and they are often specifically hunted. In the past they were hunted with boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and spears, but now they are hunted with shotguns and rifles. When you get close to a bush turkey and are ready to kill it, you can whistle. This makes them stop still and look around, allowing you to kill them easily. Bush turkeys like to eat grasshoppers called 'waniyi', and conkerberry fruit called 'baka' or 'ngamanburru'. Bush turkeys are often seen in pairs, looking around for food to eat. As they walk around they often look upwards to see if wedge-tailed eagles are hunting for them. They hide in the grass if they see you hunting them. Their small fluffy feathers can be used as body decoration for ceremonies. The throat pouch of males is called 'larraranga'. They use this pouch to make a rumbling sound when they are looking for a wife. They have the skin names Jangala or Nangala and Jambijina or Nambijina.

\ee These white grubs live in the trunks and roots of trees, mainly bloodwoods, red river gums, coolibahs, white gums, lancewood and wattle trees. They can be eaten raw or lightly cooked in hot ashes. They taste like scrambled eggs and are much sought-after. Witchetty grubs can be found in tree trunks by looking for their entrance hole. The entrance will have fine dust or excrement on the trunk or branch. The wood is then chopped just above the hole to widen it, and the grub pulled out with a piece of thin hooked wire or a hooked stick. When the grubs are in the tree roots, you can also find the entrance hole by looking for small piles of excrement. Then you dig up the plant or push it over so that the roots are exposed. In the wet season when the ground is soft, the small shrubs are just pushed over and the roots pulled up out of the ground. The grubs can then be collected easily.

\ee This turtle is similar to the long-necked turtle, but it stinks when caught due to a bad-smelling gland near its backside. This is cut out and chucked away before cooking to get rid of the smell. These turtles also bury themselves in the mud as the water dries out at the start of the dry season. This turtle only occurs in north-eastern parts of Mudburra and Jingulu country.

\ee The leaves of this plant are boiled in water to make tea to drink. In the past, the old people used this plant a lot instead of commercial tea. The tea made from this plant has a strong smell and a pleasant taste. It provides sustenance when walking a long way, especially if there is no food to be found. The tea can keep you going, making you strong when you are feeling weak. This tea also has medicinal qualities and is used to treat congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'.

\ee This small insect can be seen at night because of the small blinking light in its body. Sometimes kids play with them. They poke a little stick into them and carry them around like sparklers. When they blink at night it indicates that conkerberries, white currants and black plums have fruit and are ready to eat. The name 'linyarda' also refers to electricity, electrical equipment, coals and charcoal.

\ee The small black seeds from this plant are collected, winnowed and ground into flour, then made into small dampers or johnny cakes. These are then lightly roasted beside a fire and eaten. In the past these seeds were an important food resource. Pompey Raymond remembers his elders carrying large sacks of them around when he was young. This plant grows in large numbers in some wet areas and parts of the open plains country, so a lot of seeds could be harvested after the wet season rains had stopped. Ants also collect these seeds and sometimes you can find a good amount of the seed near an ant nest.

\ee The desert blue-tongue lizard is considered to be female and is generally smaller than northern blue-tongues. It has orange skin on its back and a black mask on its face near its eyes. The meat from this lizard is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. The skin needs to be scraped off before eating as it is quite scaly and sticks to the meat. They are easy to catch as they cannot run very fast. You can easily knock them on the head with a stick. They can bite hard, though, so you need to be careful with them. They are fattest in the hot weather season, so this is the best time to eat them.

\ee The desert blue-tongue lizard is considered to be female and is generally smaller than northern blue-tongues. It has orange skin on its back and a black mask on its face near its eyes. The meat from this lizard is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. The skin needs to be scraped off before eating as it is quite scaly and sticks to the meat. They are easy to catch as they cannot run very fast. You can easily knock them on the head with a stick. They can bite hard, though, so you need to be careful with them. They are fattest in the hot weather season, so this is the best time to eat them.

When enough are processed this way, they can be ground into a flour with a grinding stone. This flour is then mixed with water and made into small dampers, which are lightly cooked and then eaten. Dampers are very good food, and in the past they served as an important source of nutrition. Making them, however, was hard work.

\ee Soft spinifex is used to treat diarrhoea. It is collected along with termite mound. The termite mound is heated up and mixed with water and then the raw leaves are added. This is then used as medicine to treat diarrhoea or runny tummy. The wax from spinifex is called 'kirnima'. It is collected, melted and pounded a number of times to create a strong glue used in conjunction with kangaroo tendons to bind spear or axe heads to their shafts and to fix hooks to spear-thrower shafts. Spinifex leaves or wax can also be burnt to chase away mosquitoes called 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. They work like mosquito coils bought from the shop. The spiky leaves of spinifex can be called 'nyili'; this term can also be used for porcupine (echidna) spines or other prickles.

The vapours from the crushed leaves and stems are inhaled to clear a blocked nose and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. You can also put some of the crushed leaves directly into the nose. The leaves can also be boiled in water and the cooled liquid used as a wash to treat colds. Small amounts can be sipped as well to help heal a sore throat.

\ee This tree has small leaves and white sap. It grows on plains and along creek lines. The red inner bark and leaves are boiled in water until the water becomes red-coloured. This liquid is used as wash a couple of times a day to treat head sores, scabies and chicken-pox called 'jangawurru'; and nits called 'juwuda', 'mubunjini' or 'yingkila'. It can also be used as a body wash to alleviate weakness and fatigue. The wood can be burnt on a fire and the smoke, which has a nice smell, keeps away mosquitoes 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. The wood can be used to make souvenir boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and shields called 'kuwarri', but it is a bit soft for real ones. It can also be used to make whip handles. The white milk-like sap can cause blindness if it gets in your eye. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can sometimes be found in this tree.

Every person is born into one (or sometimes two) of these groups, with membership determined by which groups their parents are in. A person's skin group membership plays a big role in their life. It influences who they can marry, what their obligations within their community are, etc. Each of the eight skin groups has two names associated with it: one for the men in that group and one for the women. All the male skin names start with J, while all the female ones begin with N.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'cooking' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. It is placed over a fire and the baby is held in the smoke and steam, then washed all over with the warm mud. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called wanbuni. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee In the big wet seasons, mussels can be found in large numbers in waterholes and lakes; you can just collect them from the mud at the bottom. The meat inside the shell is eaten after lightly cooking on hot coals or in a small grass fire. As it burns, it lightly cooks the meat. The shells open up when the meat is cooked. The meat is really good tasting and nice to eat, like eating at a restaurant. The meat is also used to treat congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The hard shell can be used as a spoon, and the sharpened edge was used as a knife in the past. Shards of broken mussel shell are sharp and can cut your foot if you walk on them.

The leaves and inner bark can be boiled in water and the cooled liquid used as medicine to treat scabies and skin sores called 'jangawurru'. This medicine is strong and should not be used too much.

\ee This tree has small leaves and white sap. It grows on plains and along creek lines. The red inner bark and leaves are boiled in water until the water becomes red-coloured. This liquid is used as wash a couple of times a day to treat head sores, scabies and chicken-pox called 'jangawurru'; and nits called 'juwuda', 'mubunjini' or 'yingkila'. It can also be used as a body wash to alleviate weakness and fatigue. The wood can be burnt on a fire and the smoke, which has a nice smell, keeps away mosquitoes 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. The wood can be used to make souvenir boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and shields called 'kuwarri', but it is a bit soft for real ones. It can also be used to make whip handles. The white milk-like sap can cause blindness if it gets in your eye. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can sometimes be found in this tree.

\ee The fruit are eaten when they are ripe which is green with a slightly orange-yellow colour. They are sweet and very tasty. The unripe fruit can be buried in the sand to help them ripen. Sometimes this might take as long as two weeks. When the fruit are fully ripe they are called 'mawukala'. They have a very strong, pleasant smell, which can be noticed a long way from the plant. The wood is used as firewood as it lights quickly and easily. Red-tailed black-cockatoos called 'lirralirraka' also like to eat the seed of the fruit. The inner bark or cleaned roots can also be used as medicine. It is chipped into small pieces and boiled in water until the water becomes red. This liquid is used as a wash applied frequently to treat boils called '(w)ukurliji'; and skin sores, chicken pox, or scabies called 'jangawurru'. If the liquid is boiled more, it turns into a liniment that can be used for pains in the chest, muscles and joints. You must not get this medicine near your eyes. When the large flooding rains of the full wet season are coming, this plant can be used to chase the rains away. The leaves are placed on a fire to make smoke, and this is waved towards the rain clouds to make them go away.

It is very good food, tasting similar to the commercial cucumber you can buy in shops. The fruit must be rubbed before eating, however, to remove any short hairs from the outside. If these are not removed, they can hurt your lips and tongue. If you eat too much of this fruit, you will get a sore mouth, sore throat and a headache. This plant is recognised as being similar to the bitter cucumber, above, but it has different qualities and the fruit are smaller and sweet tasting.

The yams can be eaten after they have been roasted in a ground oven with both wet coals and hot coals. The skin is scraped off after cooking.

\ee The hard wood of this tree is especially good for making boomerangs called 'kurrubardu'. The fruit and bark are scraped and the scrapings are mixed with water to make a medicine that is applied to small children. It makes them strong and helps them start walking. The fruit are also boiled in water, and babies are made to sit in the liquid once it has cooled down. This practice also strengthens their legs and hips to help them start walking. The leaves and wood may be burnt to ash and mixed with water and this is used to treat broken bones, sore joints and bruising in adults.

\ee This type of kurrajong is a small multi-stemmed shrub. This plant grows around Elliott and Lake Woods and is common in the western areas. The large yellow seeds inside the pod can be eaten, but the hairs are dangerous and need to be removed first. The seeds are taken out of the large pod. They are then pounded and winnowed out in a coolamon called 'kawarla' or burnt to get rid of the fine hairs. Finally, they are crushed, eaten raw or made into johnny cakes. The seeds are ready to eat in October. There are lots growing at Dunmarra in sandy country. The young plants have an edible yam called 'wanyanda' below them. The skin of the inner pod of the fruit can be rubbed on the skin to make it lighter. The inner bark can be used to make string. When the sun sets in the mid dry season and turns red, like the colour of the flowers, and streaky, it indicates that the pods are ready to be collected.

\ee Speakers of Mudburra commonly recognise two dialects of their language: Eastern Mudburra (also called Kuwaarrangu) and Western Mudburra (also called Kuwirrinji). Eastern Mudburra is spoken in the area around Marlinja and Kulumindini (Elliott). Mudburra and Jingulu people have lived together in this area for a long time, and as a result their cultures and languages share many features. These shared features represent the main difference between Eastern Mudburra and Western Mudburra. Western Mudburra is spoken in the area around Yingawunarri (Top Springs), where it has had more contact with Gurindji.

\ee This plant is very good medicine. The leaves are sticky and have a strong smell. The twigs are boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat many illnesses, but is especially good for congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The young leaves can also be warmed on a fire and held against sore muscles and joints to relieve pain. The heated leafy twigs and branches can also be held against the head to relieve headaches. Leaves may be placed on hot coals so that they produce smoke, which is allowed to waft around the body to treat the same symptoms. Witchetty grubs called 'laju' are often found in the roots and at the bases of the stems of this plant. In the hot weather this plant has a good smell, like medicine.

\ee This plant is very good medicine. The leaves are sticky and have a strong smell. The twigs are boiled in water and the liquid used as a wash to treat many illnesses, but is especially good for congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. The young leaves can also be warmed on a fire and held against sore muscles and joints to relieve pain. The heated leafy twigs and branches can also be held against the head to relieve headaches. Leaves may be placed on hot coals so that they produce smoke, which is allowed to waft around the body to treat the same symptoms. Witchetty grubs called 'laju' are often found in the roots and at the bases of the stems of this plant. In the hot weather this plant has a good smell, like medicine.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) or 'ngarlu' contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees called 'kunanga' have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalinya'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngalyawurru'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kundarri' or 'kurla'. The wax at the top of the hive is called 'jikala', and 'barnmi', at the bottom of the hive. You can't eat this because it will burn your mouth. It is used with kangaroo tendon called 'nganju' to bond spearheads to their shafts. Bee droppings or shit is called 'kura'. It is seen on the ground, below the hive entrance hole. It is one way you can spot hives. When you can't chop open a tree to get at a tree hive, you can use a small brush to get the honey out of the hive instead. This brush is called a 'junji'. If you see lots of native bees caught in a spider web, it tells you that there is a hive nearby and you should hunt for it.

\ee Mudburra society is divided into eight subsections, also called skin groups. Every person is born into one (or sometimes two) of these groups, with membership determined by which groups their parents are in. A person's skin group membership plays a big role in their life. It influences who they can marry, what their obligations within their community are, etc. Each of the eight skin groups has two names associated with it: one for the men in that group and one for the women. All the male skin names start with J, while all the female ones begin with N.

\ee After a young man is initiated, he and his 'full' (i.e., biological) sisters can no longer say each other's names out loud. Instead, they might say 'so-and-so', use each other's initials, or use a nickname like 'bro' or 'sis'. Additionally, for the first few years after the initiation, the young man's sisters and female cousins can refer to him as 'yirrimaka'. Some people also follow these same restrictions with their classificatory siblings - that is, with everyone who is of the right skin group regardless of any biological relationship.

\ee The desert blue-tongue lizard is considered to be female and is generally smaller than northern blue-tongues. It has orange skin on its back and a black mask on its face near its eyes. The meat from this lizard is good to eat after roasting on hot coals and ashes. The skin needs to be scraped off before eating as it is quite scaly and sticks to the meat. They are easy to catch as they cannot run very fast. You can easily knock them on the head with a stick. They can bite hard, though, so you need to be careful with them. They are fattest in the hot weather season, so this is the best time to eat them.

\ee These kangaroos are good to eat after roasting. They often have long shaggy fur and can range in colour from dark grey to light grey to a bit reddish. The large males are quite heavily built and often a reddish colour. These kangaroos are often seen in hilly parts of the country, like in the area around Powell Creek. They rest in the hills during the hot day and come down to the slopes and plains to feed when it gets cool at dusk and during the night. They are only seen by themselves; they do not live in groups. This kangaroo is sometimes also called 'wumarangarna' in Mudburra (or 'wumarangarnarra' for a group of them). This name means rock-dweller and refers to their preferred habitat in rocky areas.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) or 'ngarlu' contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees called 'kunanga' have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalinya'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngalyawurru'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kundarri' or 'kurla'. The wax at the top of the hive is called 'jikala', and 'barnmi', at the bottom of the hive. You can't eat this because it will burn your mouth. It is used with kangaroo tendon called 'nganju' to bond spearheads to their shafts. Bee droppings or shit is called 'kura'. It is seen on the ground, below the hive entrance hole. It is one way you can spot hives. When you can't chop open a tree to get at a tree hive, you can use a small brush to get the honey out of the hive instead. This brush is called a 'junji'. If you see lots of native bees caught in a spider web, it tells you that there is a hive nearby and you should hunt for it.

It influences who they can marry, what their obligations within their community are, etc. Each of the eight skin groups has two names associated with it: one for the men in that group and one for the women.

\ee This shrub produces fruit in the wet season. They are sweet and very tasty, and are eaten when they are black. When the fireflies are active at night, with their lights blinking on and off, the fruit are ripe and ready to eat. Many different birds also eat the fruit, including emus called 'karnanganja' and bush turkeys called 'kurrkabadi'. The roots are used to cure toothaches. They are dug up and the inner, bright orange wood is scraped off in fine shavings. This can be pushed into the hole of a rotten tooth to stop the pain. The roots of large plants can be used to make small come-back boomerangs.

They are mostly active at night when they hunt for a feed. The meat inside the shell is good to eat after roasting on hot coals. Many waterbirds also eat them.

\ee The papery bark from these trees has multiple uses. It can be used to make coolamons by tying the ends together with bush string. It can be used for wrapping food before cooking in ashes or in a ground oven. Large sheets of this bark can be used to make wet season shelters to keep the rain off, or dry season shelters to keep the sun off. The bark is good to put inside wooden coolamons called 'kawarla' to create a soft padding for a baby to lie on. The bark can be used to make a pouch to carry stone knives and stone spearheads so they remain sharp and do not get damaged.

\ee Native bee-hives or 'sugarbag' (in Kriol) or 'ngarlu' contain sweet dark honey that is very tasty and much sought after. The hives also contain wax, pollen and eggs. The small bees called 'kunanga' have no sting and are harmless. Sugarbag occurs in three main areas. One is found in hollows in trees, one occurs in the ground and the other in termite mounds. Ground sugarbag is called 'nangkalinya'. Tree sugarbag is called 'ngalyawurru'. The yellow eggs and pollen in the hive are called 'kundarri' or 'kurla'. The wax at the top of the hive is called 'jikala', and 'barnmi', at the bottom of the hive. You can't eat this because it will burn your mouth. It is used with kangaroo tendon called 'nganju' to bond spearheads to their shafts. Bee droppings or shit is called 'kura'. It is seen on the ground, below the hive entrance hole. It is one way you can spot hives. When you can't chop open a tree to get at a tree hive, you can use a small brush to get the honey out of the hive instead. This brush is called a 'junji'. If you see lots of native bees caught in a spider web, it tells you that there is a hive nearby and you should hunt for it.

\ee 'Ngarrka' refers to a man who has completed the initiation ceremony and is a fully-grown adult (about 20 years of age or older). Before this, when he is newly-initiated and still young (in his mid or late teens, perhaps), he is called 'yaba' instead. 'Ngarrka' can also sometimes refer to Aboriginal people in general (not just men), in the same way that the English word 'mankind' has sometimes been used to mean all people.

It is the best wood for coolamons as it is easy to carve but strong, light and long-lasting. It is especially good for making coolamons for carrying babies. The lumps on the trunks and branches can be chopped open to get water from inside. The two-winged fruit are used as toy helicopters by children, who like to throw them in the air and play with them as they twirl down.

\ee Eel-tail catfish are good to eat, with soft, tender flesh and very few bones. They are cooked by roasting on hot coals and ashes. They can get quite big, up to 25 cm long. They have nails or prickles in their fins, and, if these poke you, the wound will swell and be very painful for a long time. You can ease the pain by poking that same area with the same prickle again. In the mid to late wet season when the floodwaters are starting to form, there are often schools of baby nailfish called 'ngirnngirda' in the grassy water edges. These can be collected in large numbers and all cooked together and then eaten. They taste good and are too small to have dangerous spines.

\ee Mudburra society is divided into eight 'manyku' or 'ngurnanga' (subsections, also called skin groups). Every person is born into one (or sometimes two) of these groups, with membership determined by which groups their parents are in. A person's skin group membership plays a big role in their life. It influences who they can marry, what their obligations within their community are, etc. Each of the eight skin groups has two names associated with it: one for the men in that group and one for the women. All the male skin names start with J, while all the female ones begin with N.

\ee In the past, dingo scalps were collected and sold to the police at Newcastle Waters and Elliott as part of a control program. Dingoes were eaten in the past when other meat was scarce. The pups were most tender and were good to eat. The meat tasted similar to meat from a cat. They have not been eaten for a long time. People in the old days used to keep dingoes as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and lizards. They were very good at finding game and were sometimes called 'goanna dogs'. They were not good pets, though, because they would kill animals at stations such as chickens and goats. Dingoes breed in the cold weather time of the dry season, when they are often heard howling at night.

\ee Possum meat can be eaten after roasting in a ground oven with paperbark; it is very tasty meat and quite tender. Sometimes possums sleep in the forks of trees, but more often, they prefer to live in hollow parts of large trees. They often live together in groups; sometimes there are several, maybe four, inside one large hollow tree. You can see their climbing tracks on the trunks of trees that they live in. When you find a tree they are in, you throw a stone down the hole, and they will run out. When you catch a possum, you have to be careful, as they have sharp claws and can scratch you. They like hollow snappy gums, bloodwoods, coolabahs and river red gums. They sleep all day in these hollow trees and hunt around for food in the night. They don't like the sunshine. They really like to eat sugar-leaf (lerps) called 'wandala' or 'nanjarrnga'; and sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu'. They also eat flowers and ripe fruit. There were lots at Longreach, Beetaloo Station and Murranji in the past, but now there are very few. There are still some at Daly Waters, but in recent times none have been seen around Elliott.

\ee The flesh of the porcupine (echidna) is tasty and can be eaten after roasting or cooking in a ground oven. The meat has a lot of white-yellow coloured fat that is also good to eat. It tastes really good eaten with salt and damper or johnny cakes. The prickles and feet are chopped off with an axe or large knife prior to cooking the whole body. The prickles can be softened by placing them on hot coals for a short time or by placing them in a bucket of very hot water. Porcupines often live in rocky country, where they hide in crevasses and cracks. They can be pulled out with wire hooks or hooked branches. They are much more commonly seen at night than during the day, as they walk around at night looking for food. Porcupines are most active during full moon periods in the cold weather of the dry season. When they walk they leave a little track where the prickles drag along the ground. If you follow these tracks, they often lead to antbeds where the porcupines are looking for ants and termites to eat. When caught, porcupines hold tight to the ground or a nearby tree trunk. When there is a grass fire they often walk on the road, where they get hit by cars and trucks. They have skin name Jangari or Nangari.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'cooking' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. It is placed over a fire and the baby is held in the smoke and steam, then washed all over with the warm mud. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called wanbuni. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

\ee There are many types of finches, all of which are small and often colourful. They often live in grassy areas near rivers and creeks called 'binka'; and hang around leaky taps or sprinklers looking for a drink. They can be followed to find water in times of dry but this is a practice more commonly associated with Western Mudburra speakers than with people around Elliott. They have the skin names Jurla or Nawurla and Jabarda or Nimarra.

\ee In the past people used to eat cat meat after roasting it in a ground oven. It has a strong smell and a good taste, like possum meat. It was eaten up until recent times and it is still a favoured meat for many elders. The name 'nyurnam' refers to the round shape of their faces. Sometimes you can tease people by calling them 'nyurnambari', meaning 'pussy cat face'. Feral cats are good hunters and eat a lot of small native animals. The males, tom cats, can get very large and aggressive.

Appropriate ('straight') marriage partnerships are as follows: Janama-Nawurla, Jurla-Nanaku, Jabarda-Nalyirri, Jalyirri-Nimarra, Jimija-Nangala, Jangala-Namija, Jambijina-Nangari, Jangari-Nambijina.

\ee These lizards can be aggressive; the big ones will chase you if you go near them. When you try to catch them they often hide behind a tree or antbed. They like to eat ants, termites, grasshoppers and the flying ants that come out after rain. You often see them near antbeds looking for a feed. The meat of this lizard is eaten after roasting on hot coals and ashes. You can also burn its frill on a fire and then rub it through your hair to make your hair grow long and stay black. This lizard is the brother of 'kidkilyi' (ring-tailed dragon). They both have the skin name Jangala. They had a fight in the Dreamtime. Kidkilyi went to live in the plains country and Jamankula went to the red soil country around Daly Waters.

\ee This small wallaby has distinctive orange fur around its eyes, like it's wearing orange glasses, hence the name. It sleeps in a tunnel in the grass or under dense shade during the day and feeds at night. Wambana is quite small, about the size of a middle-sized dog. It eats green grass, along with ants from ant nests like a porcupine (echidna) does. Mothers have one baby at a time. When it is small they carry it in their pouch When the baby gets big, it runs around by itself. The little one suckles milk from the mother. These wallabies are not eaten now, but they were eaten in the past by the old people. They are hard to spear or hit with a boomerang, because they run really fast in scrubby country. Dogs and dingoes are good at sniffing them out; they can find their nests easily and run straight to them. A full grown 'wambana' would feed about three adult people. Some Jingulu people think 'wambana' make a whistling noise to help them find their way home. These wallabies have not been seen much in recent times. In the past they were often seen near lancewood, turpentine and bulwaddy country, sometimes resting in a little hole in the shade. There are some on Dungowan Station near Murranji. Pompey Raymond also used to see lots on Ucharonidge Station when he was a young man around 1960. Wambana has the skin names Jangala and Jambijina which makes them father and son. It was a Dreaming for Biddy Wavehill and Billy Bunter, well-known elders from Gurindji country to the west.

\ee The fine soil from inside antbeds can be used to treat diarrhoea. It is heated on a fire and then added to warm water. This is allowed to settle for a while, so that the grass bits which float to the top can be skimmed off. It is then drunk. This mixture also promotes milk for nursing mothers. This wet antbed soil is also used when 'burning' babies to strengthen their lower back and legs and help them start walking. This makes the baby physically strong in later life. To 'burn' a baby, light a fire and heat up some pieces of antbed. When the fire has burned down to coals, the antbed pieces will be glowing red. Scoop some out to one side, then put some water on the fire and cover it with leafy twigs such as 'mulurrmi' (turpentine wattle) or 'bikirra' (grass type), and then put the reserved chunks of antbed on top. When the plants heat up and begin to smoke, hold the baby over them so that the smoke goes all over the baby and its mother. The pieces of antbed are crushed during the smoking to reveal still-red parts. Cooled charred pieces of antbed are used to treat sick people (especially infants). They are crushed in water to make a thick black slurry. The slurry is rubbed on a child from head to toe. The black water may also be sipped. Ground sugarbag called 'nangkalinya' is often found in antbeds, especially in the large rounded ones called 'wanbuni'. Porcupines (echidnas) are also sometimes found camped in the holes in antbeds, as they like to eat the termites inside. You can also dig out a cavity in the side of the very large, round mounds, and camp in there to stay dry in the wet season.

They rest in the hills during the hot day and come down to the slopes and plains to feed when it gets cool at dusk and during the night. They are only seen by themselves; they do not live in groups.

\ee This large tree is common on Mudburra country. It is an excellent shade tree. Many birds sit in this tree and like to eat the red flowers. The inner red bark of the trunk or the roots can be used to make a strong medicine. They are boiled in water and the liquid is used as a wash, and a little is drunk, to treat headaches; scabies, skin ulcers, skin sores called 'jangawurru'; and congestion (bad cold) called 'kudkulya'. This medicine is used a few times a day for a few days and will cure most skin problems. The leaves can also be chewed to treat congestion. They can also be chewed when you are thirsty and in need of water. This helps to produce saliva and stops the feeling of intense thirst. The gum is called 'kuramarna' which refers to the edible gum from any tree. The fruit or pods are called 'ngabilibili'. Sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu' can be found in the trunk of this tree, and also in the roots sometimes. The red flowers can be sucked to get the sweet nectar. They can also be collected in a tin and mixed with water to make a sweet drink. The outer bark is burnt to a fine white ash called 'buna', which is then added to chewing tobacco called 'warnu'. The twigs can be made into paint brushes or spoons called 'junji' used for painting or for extracting honey.

\ee These kangaroos are good to eat after roasting. They often have long shaggy fur and can range in colour from dark grey to light grey to a bit reddish. The large males are quite heavily built and often a reddish colour. These kangaroos are often seen in hilly parts of the country, like in the area around Powell Creek. They rest in the hills during the hot day and come down to the slopes and plains to feed when it gets cool at dusk and during the night. They are only seen by themselves; they do not live in groups. This kangaroo is sometimes also called 'wumarangarna' (or 'wumarangarnarra' for a group of them). This name means rock-dweller and refers to their preferred habitat in rocky areas.

\ee These turtles are only found in northern areas closer to Top Springs, and are known to be common around Timber Creek, Bradshaw and Auvergne country. These turtles are large and have a long neck. They bury themselves in mud as the water dries out at the start of the dry season. You can find them by poking a digging stick into the mud and listening for the tapping sound that means you've hit one on the shell. You can then dig the turtle up, cook it and eat it. The name 'wardjayi' is also used for large green sea turtles, which are sometimes brought back by hunters who have visited saltwater Yanyula country.

In the Dreamtime, a number of 'kiwarlija' came up from Tennant Creek to Murranji. A couple of them then went to Beetaloo; these were the quiet 'kiwarlija' (i.e. olive or rock pythons). Two others went west as the aggressive 'kiwarlija' (i.e. king browns) and turned into the 'jurndakal', a taipan-like snake. They have the skin names Jimija and Jalyirri and are father and son.

\ee This is the biggest hunting bird. They can catch small kangaroos and wallabies and also hunt for bush turkeys called 'kurrkabadi'. They are often seen high in the sky, slowly circling and looking for food. They also like to eat roadkill. They often get hit by cars because they are slow to take off. There is an important Dreamtime story about this bird which is connected to men's business. It has the skin names Jalyirri or Nalyirri and Jimija or Namija.

\ee You mix tobacco with 'buna' (ashes). The ashes are the burnt bark of 'babingi' (wild pawpaw), 'kamanji' (bulwaddy), 'bularraku' (smoke tree), 'darralyaka' (ghost gum), 'kurruda' (hill bloodwood) or 'wanyarri' or 'jingi' (bauhinia). Ashes give the tobacco more bite and enhance the effect of the nicotine.

\ee The wood of this tree is hard, strong and dark in colour. It makes excellent firewood as it burns evenly for long periods. The smoke from the burning wood repels mosquitoes called 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. The trunks and roots often contain witchetty grubs called 'laju', which are good to eat. The stems can be used for bough shelters, fence rails and fence posts. The wood is also used for boomerangs called 'kurrubardu'; clapsticks called 'karnbaj' or 'kurndarnnga'; spearheads; shields called 'kuwarri'; and fighting sticks called 'kuduru'. The outer bark is called 'manjarna' or 'kurrunyu'. It can be pulled off the trunks and used to make bough shelters or humpies. The dried bark is also good for lighting fires. The inner part of the fluted trunk bark can be chewed and sucked. It is not much food, but it's good for keeping your mouth moist. The inner bark can also be used as a spoon or brush called a 'junji' to extract honey from sugarbag (native bee-hives) called 'ngarlu'. The string or rope made from this inner bark is called 'yubungu'.

\ee Soft spinifex is used to treat diarrhoea. It is collected along with termite mound. The termite mound is heated up and mixed with water and then the raw leaves are added. This is then used as medicine to treat diarrhoea or runny tummy. The wax from spinifex is called 'kirnima'. It is collected, melted and pounded a number of times to create a strong glue used in conjunction with kangaroo tendons to bind spear or axe heads to their shafts and to fix hooks to spear-thrower shafts. Spinifex leaves or wax can also be burnt to chase away mosquitoes called 'bangkula' or 'kanamurrmurra'. They work like mosquito coils bought from the shop. The spiky leaves of spinifex can be called 'nyili'; this term can also be used for porcupine (echidna) spines or other prickles.

Children might also get mesmerised by the cry of the curlew and be driven mad by it. Adults used to knock on a tin can to distract the children from the curlew's cry. There is a big Dreamtime story about this bird, but it is restricted and can't be told publicly. It is a Dreaming for some people. This bird has the skin name Jangari or Nangari.

\ee In the past, dingo scalps were collected and sold to the police at Newcastle Waters and Elliott as part of a control program. Dingoes were eaten in the past when other meat was scarce. The pups were most tender and were good to eat. The meat tasted similar to meat from a cat. They have not been eaten for a long time. People in the old days used to keep dingoes as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and lizards. They were very good at finding game and were sometimes called 'goanna dogs'. They were not good pets, though, because they would kill animals at stations such as chickens and goats. Dingoes breed in the cold weather time of the dry season, when they are often heard howling at night.

There is a big Dreamtime story about this bird, but it is restricted and can't be told publicly. It is a Dreaming for some people. This bird has the skin name Jangari or Nangari.

They hop around very quickly and are difficult to spear. In the past they were hunted by finding the paths they travel on and setting a hunter with a stick to wait. Other hunters would scare the rock wallaby so that it hopped down the track towards the other hunter who would hit it hard with the stick. They were then roasted and eaten, though there is not much meat as they are quite small. This kangaroo is different from 'minawud'.

\ee In the past, dingo scalps were collected and sold to the police at Newcastle Waters and Elliott as part of a control program. Dingoes were eaten in the past when other meat was scarce. The pups were most tender and were good to eat. The meat tasted similar to meat from a cat. They have not been eaten for a long time. People in the old days used to keep dingoes as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and lizards. They were very good at finding game and were sometimes called 'goanna dogs'. They were not good pets, though, because they would kill animals at stations such as chickens and goats. Dingoes breed in the cold weather time of the dry season, when they are often heard howling at night.

\ee Bilbies look a bit like rabbits. They have long ears, a pointy nose and a long tail with a white tip. They have a single baby in the cool weather time, after the rains have finished. Bilbies like to eat grass and witchetty grubs, called 'laju', which they look for in turpentine wattles and lancewood trees. They sniff along the roots of trees to smell witchetty grubs, then dig and bite open the roots to get the grubs. They live in lancewood country or in sandy country, more commonly in southern areas, and dig large burrow systems with deep tunnels and lots of holes. People hunt them by digging the burrows up with digging sticks; while someone digs, others wait near the burrows exits to throw boomerangs at the animals when they run out. Bilbies are very fast runners and are hard to hit with a boomerang. Sometimes they were also hunted with goanna dogs that would go down goanna and bilby burrows and chase the animals out. Bilbies were eaten in the past, but have not been eaten in recent times. A large one would feed two or three adults. They taste good, like a feral rabbit or a porcupine (echidna). They were gutted, held over flames to burn off the fur and then cooked in a ground oven. Pythons and feral cats also like to eat bilbies. The long white fluffy tail can be used in the initiation ceremony for young men. The tails are worn on a headband and around the neck, and you cannot speak while wearing them. They were also worn by men to attract a partner. Bilbies used to be quite common at Beetaloo. After the end of the Second World War, there were lots. Now there are very few.

\ee Bilbies look a bit like rabbits. They have long ears, a pointy nose and a long tail with a white tip. They have a single baby in the cool weather time, after the rains have finished. Bilbies like to eat grass and witchetty grubs, called 'laju', which they look for in turpentine wattles and lancewood trees. They sniff along the roots of trees to smell witchetty grubs, then dig and bite open the roots to get the grubs. They live in lancewood country or in sandy country, more commonly in southern areas, and dig large burrow systems with deep tunnels and lots of holes. People hunt them by digging the burrows up with digging sticks; while someone digs, others wait near the burrows exits to throw boomerangs at the animals when they run out. Bilbies are very fast runners and are hard to hit with a boomerang. Sometimes they were also hunted with goanna dogs that would go down goanna and bilby burrows and chase the animals out. Bilbies were eaten in the past, but have not been eaten in recent times. A large one would feed two or three adults. They taste good, like a feral rabbit or a porcupine (echidna). They were gutted, held over flames to burn off the fur and then cooked in a ground oven. Pythons and feral cats also like to eat bilbies. The long white fluffy tail can be used in the initiation ceremony for young men. The tails are worn on a headband and around the neck, and you cannot speak while wearing them. They were also worn by men to attract a partner. Bilbies used to be quite common at Beetaloo. After the end of the Second World War, there were lots. Now there are very few.

\ee In the past, dingo scalps were collected and sold to the police at Newcastle Waters and Elliott as part of a control program. Dingoes were eaten in the past when other meat was scarce. The pups were most tender and were good to eat. The meat tasted similar to meat from a cat. They have not been eaten for a long time. People in the old days used to keep dingoes as pets and for hunting kangaroos, goannas and lizards. They were very good at finding game and were sometimes called 'goanna dogs'. They were not good pets, though, because they would kill animals at stations such as chickens and goats. Dingoes breed in the cold weather time of the dry season, when they are often heard howling at night.

\ee This tree grows in northern areas of Jingulu and Mudburra country; there are lots around Larrimah. The swollen tap root of young plants can be dug up, roasted and then eaten. It is a long thin yam which is good to eat. The bark of young plants can be made into string. This string is very long-lasting and strong. It can be used to tie spearheads onto spear shafts or hooks onto spear-throwers, or to tie up bundles of food, firewood or any other items. In the past it was used to make nagas or loincloths for women, and was used to make special headbands worn by men during ceremonies. Paint brushes can be made from twigs and from small saplings. The ends are crushed with a stone to make the brush part. The gum can be used as medicine. It is applied directly to sores and cuts. The inner bark is also used as a bandage, as it has an open weave pattern like a bandage. It is good for treating cuts and wounds from being hit with boomerangs called 'kurrubardu' and fighting sticks called 'kuduru'.

\ee This is the largest kangaroo and the adult males can be very tall and muscular. The meat is eaten after roasting and is very tasty. Some people think this is the best kangaroo meat. They are most commonly seen in the southern areas, but they live everywhere. They are common in the Elliott area and other places like Marlinja and Beetaloo. This kangaroo is sometimes also called 'kajangarna' (or 'kajangarnarra' for a group of them). This name means bush-dweller and refers to their preferred habitat in bush areas.
