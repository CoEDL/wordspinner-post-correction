        Every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in this dictionary is completely public. No reference is made to men and women's business or private body parts. Nonetheless users are warned that there may be words and descriptions which may be culturally sensitive and which might not normally be used in certain public or community contexts. All texts, images and audio of deceased people in this database are used with permission from Mudburra families. Nonetheless users of this dictionary should be aware that, for Mudburra people, seeing images of deceased persons or hearing them may cause sadness or distress and in some cases, offend against strongly held cultural prohibitions.
