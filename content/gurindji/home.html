        Gurindji is a language of the southern Victoria River District and northern Tanami region in the Northern Territory (Australia). Gurindji people became well known in the 1960–70s due to their influence on Australian politics and the Indigenous rights movement. They were instrumental in gaining equal wages for Aboriginal cattle station employees and they were also the first Aboriginal group to recover control of their traditional lands.
